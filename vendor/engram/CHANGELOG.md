# Changelog

## 1.10.1 — 2026-07-29 · The plugin directory that was pretending to be two things

A community PR ([#14](https://github.com/nagisanzenin/engram/pull/14), thanks
[@luanweslley77](https://github.com/luanweslley77)) — the first outside contribution to the OpenCode
layer. `.opencode/` held three different things at once: TypeScript source, the runtime extraction
target, and npm artifacts. That is why an `install-type` split had to exist at all — extracting in
dev mode would have overwritten the source it was extracting from.

**Source moved to `.opencode-plugin/`**, so the extraction target is only ever a target. With that
true, `detectInstallType()` had nothing left to decide and is gone: `selfExtract()` always runs.
Dev mode, which quietly did not work, now does. `command/` → `commands/` (OpenCode's discovery glob
is `{command,commands}/**/*.md`, so both spellings resolve — but shipping both would double-register
the three commands, which is why the rename comes with a cleanup). `engram_update` is hidden by
`cfg.permission` as well as `cfg.tools`, which is the mechanism OpenCode's runtime actually uses.

### What review caught before it merged

**A recursive delete that reached outside the project.** The first version of the legacy-directory
cleanup was `rmSync(target/command, {recursive: true})`. `.opencode/command/` is not Engram's
directory — it is the documented home for a user's *own* OpenCode commands, and Engram only ever
wrote three files into it. Worse, `getExtractTarget()` falls back to the **global**
`~/.config/opencode/` when a project has no `opencode.json`, so for those projects the delete
landed in the user's home directory. Both were reproduced by running them, not by reading the diff.
It now unlinks Engram's own three files and `rmdirSync`s the directory, which succeeds only if it is
already empty.

**And a documented safety decision, reversed.** The PR switched `.git/info/exclude` from `.engram-*`
to `.opencode/`, four lines beneath a docstring explaining why that is exactly wrong: `.opencode/`
holds the user's own agents and commands, `.git/info/exclude` is invisible from the working tree,
and an exclude that outlives its reason is a trap where `git status` goes quiet about files the user
meant to commit. The guard test written to hold that function honest had been **flipped to assert
the new behaviour** — which is the signal to stop and read the docstring, not the signal to proceed.
Reverted. The underlying need was real but dev-side: this repo's own `.opencode/` is generated output
now, so it went into the repo's `.gitignore`, where it belongs.

### Fixed here

The manifest migration the PR added — a `.engram-update.jsonc` written by ≤1.9.1 carries the
singular `categories.command` — **shipped with no test**, so back-compat was true by inspection
only. Three checks now pin it at the single `readManifest` gate, including the `remaining` and
`applied` arrays (a stale `"command"` in `remaining` names a category that no longer exists) and the
case where both keys are present. All three mutation-tested.

### Also worth saying out loud

`@opencode-ai/plugin` moved from `dependencies` to `peerDependencies` inside a commit labelled
`chore`. It is not a chore: `update-tool.ts` imports `tool` as a **value**, so the package is a
runtime requirement. It checks out — npm resolves the peer into the lockfile, CI's `bun install`
does too, and OpenCode installs the SDK into its own tree, so the host genuinely provides it and this
avoids a second mismatched copy. Correct, but it was packaging scope riding under a label a reviewer
would skim past.

### Tests

vitest **162 → 164**, all three new checks mutation-tested (3/3 caught by their own check). The only
line of `engram.py` this release changes is `ENGRAM_VERSION`, so no engine behaviour moves —
`selftest` stays at **302/302** and the fuzz gate was re-run against it anyway (0 crashes / 600
states), because *"nothing changed"* is a claim and the fuzzer is a measurement.

**§4.8 numbers audit: nothing to audit.** This release adds no number, no rate, and no count to any
surface. **§5.5 and §5.7 are not triggered** — `skills/`, `agents/`, `codex/` and `hooks/` are
byte-identical to v1.10.0, so no shared prose reaches the other five platforms. **§5.6, the user
session, was not run**, for the same reason as v1.10.0: it needs a human learning something across
real days. Nothing here changes what a learner sees; the whole diff is the OpenCode install path.
A §5 live test drove a real 1.9.1-shaped install through the upgrade — user files kept, Engram's
legacy copies swept, an unrelated `.opencode/agent/` untouched, the exclude still on `.engram-*`,
and a second run a true no-op.

## 1.10.0 — 2026-07-28 · The answerable rubric

[Issue #13](https://github.com/nagisanzenin/engram/issues/13): *"the rubric expects a part that no
reasonable person would include in their answer just going by the probe. I answer the probes as they
are presented but get punished because I miss part of the rubric that I couldn't reasonably come up
with."* Reported at 3–4 nodes per 20-node DAG, with the reporter repairing each one by hand.

It reproduces, and it is not model noise. **The two agent specs disagreed by construction.** The
architect anchored the probe to the claim — *"a free-recall question whose answer is the claim"* —
and left the rubric free to ask for more than the claim contains. The assessor then requires **all**
criteria for `recalled`, rounds down when torn, and has no instruction anywhere permitting it to
discount a criterion the probe never requested. Every mismatch therefore resolved against the
learner, and nothing in the system could even see it happening.

**And the grade is not the damage.** The grade writes an FSRS receipt. A rubric asking for something
the probe never requested does not merely annoy someone — it **schedules real reviews of material
they already know**, forever, quietly. That is a defect in the instrument, which is why this is
engine code and not just a better prompt.

### What it looks like at scale

Measured over **62 architect-authored nodes** in three topics before a line was written:

- **24 (39%)** carry a *framing / purpose / consequence* criterion — "frames it as…", "connects it
  to…", "draws the consequence…", "states the purpose is…".
- It sits in the **last** rubric slot in 19 of those 24 (11× at 3-of-3, 8× at 4-of-4). The failure
  has a shape: write the criteria that answer the probe, then add one more that reframes.
- Of the graded receipts on nodes carrying one, that criterion was the one marked missed in
  **8 of 8**.

The assessor had been narrating the defect all along, into notes nobody aggregated —
*"**Answered both direct probe asks cold**, so core is present"* (graded `partial`);
*"'frames it as a freshness-vs-speed tradeoff' — MISSED… **the probe itself supplied that
framing**"*; *"named 'cdn' correctly (**probe already supplied 'edge-caching building block'**),
but produced no description"*.

**The honest scope of that number:** three topics, one account, one architect model family. It is
evidence that the defect is systematic and shaped, not a population estimate, and the 39% should not
be quoted as a rate for anyone else's graphs.

### The fix, in four places — because no single one of them is sufficient

**Theory / agents.** The architect now states that the probe and the rubric are **one object**, with
a three-step self-check done literally per node: read the probe alone, write the answer a competent
learner would give, mark that answer against your own rubric — *every criterion it fails is a defect
in the probe or the rubric, never in the learner*. Plus the mirror rule: **if the probe says it, the
rubric may not require it.**

**And the embarrassing part, said out loud:** the bullet that shipped this bug *demonstrated* it.
The spec's own example rubric was `["names both terms", "explains why normalization is needed"]`,
printed directly beneath a definition of `probe` as *"a question whose answer is the claim"* — and
the claim ("the posterior is the prior reweighted by likelihood and renormalized") says nothing
about why normalization is needed. A learner answering that probe perfectly was capped at `partial`
**by the example**. It has been rewritten into a coherent pair.

**Engine — `add-topic` warns at authoring time.** A deterministic check pairs each rubric criterion
against the probe by *family*: a criterion demanding a framing, a consequence, or a why is flagged
only when the probe requests nothing of **that kind**. A warning, never a `die()` — a payload costs
real minutes to author and a false positive must never destroy one.

Measured on three corpora, because one corpus measures the author's own habits: **precision 0.83 /
recall 0.71** on a 48-pair adversarial set with ground truth fixed before the code ran; **7 of the 8**
receipt-confirmed cases on real graphs (fires on 37% of 60 nodes); **7%** on the shipped gold set.
Those are the numbers after the review below; the first draft measured **0.34**.

**Engine — `doctor` finds the ones you already have.** New `probe_gaps`, uncapped, one narrator line
per topic naming the repair command. A **note**, never an issue: a graph authored before this check
existed is not corrupt, and flipping `doctor` red for the engine's own past leniency is the trap the
artifact note learned two releases ago.

**Agents — `probe_gap` on the assessor's output.** The regex catches a shape; only a reader catches
meaning. The blind assessor now reports the 1-based criteria the probe never asked for — and
**⚠ it does not move the grade, by explicit instruction.** Forgiving a criterion because the probe
was badly written would inflate the one number this repo cannot ship wrong and bury the defect
inside a better-looking score. It perceives; `edit-node` repairs; the grade stays honest about what
was actually produced. `doctor` collects both halves into one list.

**Engine — `edit-node`, the verb that was missing.** Until now the only way to change a probe was
`add-topic --replace`: re-author an entire topic to fix one sentence. Nobody makes that trade
mid-session, so the mismatch stayed and kept scheduling. `edit-node --topic T --node N --probe …`
(and/or `--rubric-json`, `--transfer-probe`) edits **the contract and nothing else** — `fsrs`,
`state`, `artifact`, `retired`, `arc` and every receipt are untouched, and the node records `revised`
with the date, the fields, and how many receipts predate the change, so a later reader cannot compare
a v2 rubric against v1 verdicts and see a learner who got worse.

**Behavior.** `/learn` and `/review` relay a `probe_gap` as *the card's fault, not yours*, then repair
it in the session while the misfiring criterion is still on screen — and grade the production exactly
as it stands. `/review` also runs the check by hand before marking any criterion missed.

### What was cut, and why that is the finding

A second detector — *leak-then-demand*, where the probe states the thing in its stem and a criterion
requires it back — was written, measured, and **removed**. Word overlap cannot separate a probe that
**asserts** a fact from one that **asks** about it: *"what does the model condition on?"* shares
nearly every content word with the criterion that answers it, so the rule flagged correct nodes. It
now lives only where meaning is available — the architect's self-check and the assessor's
`probe_gap`. **A warning nobody believes is worse than no warning**, and this repo has shipped enough
gates that cry wolf to know the difference. (Precisely: the scan has **no rule** for the mirror case
and catches one only by coincidence, when the criterion *also* demands an elaboration. A mirror
criterion phrased as plain recall is invisible to it, and the specs say so rather than implying
coverage the code does not have.)

### What the dogfood found — in this release's own spec

The blind assessor emitted `probe_gap` unprompted from the spec alone, it rode the receipt intact,
it reached `doctor` beside the deterministic scan, and it caught the leak-then-demand criterion the
regex is documented as unable to reason about. It also **did not move either grade** — though on one
item the separation between `partial` and `recalled` rested entirely on a criterion the field had
just flagged as unfair, which is exactly where an inflating grader would have inflated.

And it found two ambiguities **in the instruction I had just written**, both of which changed its
output:

- *"Judge it the way the learner met it"* parses two ways — *read the probe alone* and *only flag
  what they missed*. Those disagree. It is now **judge from the probe ONLY, never the production**,
  stated as its own warning, because a criterion the learner happened to volunteer is still unfair
  if the question never asked for it.
- The headline bar (*"the probe does not request"*) and the elaboration bar (*"a competent answer
  could not reach"*) were different widths, and a real criterion sat between them. There is now
  **one bar, and it is the word *necessarily***.

This is the fourth time this repo has recorded a grader defect that traced to an ambiguity in the
grader's own spec rather than to the grader. The pattern is not going away, and the only thing that
has ever caught one is handing the spec to a reader who was told nothing else.

Two more from building it, both caught by measuring rather than by reading: an unbounded `connects?`
matched **"least-connections"** and flagged a criterion the probe plainly asked for; and a single
probe-level "does this ask for elaboration at all?" boolean flagged all three criteria of a node
whose probe said *"give the mechanism"* — which requests a framing and says nothing about
consequences. Both are now pinned by checks that fail if the fix is reverted.

### What the adversarial review found — 13 defects, one HIGH, behind 294 green checks

Two independent reviewers were pointed at an extracted release tree. Between them they found
thirteen defects that every mechanical gate had passed over, and the pattern is this file's oldest:
**a green selftest says nothing about the design.**

**HIGH — the assessor half of `doctor` could never clear.** Receipts are append-only, so the
cross-reference replayed every historical `probe_gap` on every run. A learner who repaired a node
*exactly as the narrator instructed* watched the count refuse to move, and was re-offered the same
now-useless repair command forever. **The release's own published instrument property — *a repaired
probe must stop warning* — held for the regex half only.** A flag is now dropped when the node was
revised at or after the receipt, when the criterion index no longer exists in the current rubric,
and when the node is gone or retired. That is also what finally makes `revised` a field something
*reads*, rather than one more guard nobody consumes.

**And the check itself was measurably not believable.** A reviewer built a 48-pair set with ground
truth fixed before running anything and measured **precision 0.34** — two of every three warnings
wrong. Worse, it falsified the load-bearing property directly: **six of seven natural repairs of a
probe still fired**, including one repaired with the criterion's own verb (*"...and what **connects**
it to horizontal scaling?"*). The selftest passed only because it asserted the single phrasing that
had been hand-tuned into the regex — a confirmatory test on the one example the author had in mind.

The root cause was an asymmetry nobody would spot by reading: the *demand* side was written with
inflections (`connects?`, `consequences?`, `\w*`) and the *request* side was not, so every
inflection mismatch became a false positive. `implicat` could never match at all — the trailing
`\b` requires a non-word character after it, and every real inflection continues with one. Fixed by
inflecting the request side, and then by removing the dependence on that list entirely: **if the
probe uses the criterion's own demand word, in any inflection, the criterion is never flagged.** An
enumerated list cannot guarantee that property, because the list is finite and English is not.

Three demand markers were **ordinary rubric vocabulary** and are gone: `so that` and `matters` (a
titration step reads *"sets up the burette **so that** the meniscus reads zero"*), `notes that`, and
a bare `links?` — which matched the **noun** "link" in a curriculum about certificate chains
(*"one failing **link** fails the whole chain"*). That is the same noun/verb collision as `connects?`
matching "least-connections", one release later, inside the fix for it.

The rest, each now pinned: `receipts_under_previous` counted *every* receipt rather than those since
the last revision, so summing the stamps exceeded the receipts on disk and the label was false —
falsifying this release's own numbers audit, which claimed it *"cannot overcount"*; `doctor`
interpolated hand-editable ids into a shell command the skills are written to **paste**;
`add-topic` warned about retired nodes and re-warned every untouched node on an `--extend`, while
`doctor` called the same nodes clean; a `no-rubric` finding got a narrator sentence describing the
wrong defect and a repair command that is a no-op; both detectors reaching one criterion produced
two rows in the list the numbers audit reconciles by length; `edit-node` stamped a revision for a
no-op edit and misreported a corrupt node as an unknown one.

**The uncomfortable one:** the numbers audit in `docs/release-audits/` was written before the review
and asserted two properties the review falsified. It has been corrected in place rather than
quietly, because *"a provenance field that lies is worse than none"* applies to an audit document
at least as much as to a payload.

**Known miss, stated rather than rounded away:** the check goes silent on any probe containing an
explicit `why`/`explain`, which is what stops it flagging criteria such a probe plainly invited. That
costs one of the eight confirmed cases (`cap-theorem`, whose probe ends *"and why can't you escape
it?"* while criterion 1 asks for a scoping the probe never requests). Recall was traded for the one
property that makes an authoring warning worth having: **a repaired probe must stop warning.**

### The gate that did not run

**§5.6, the user session, was not run for this release.** It is the one gate that asks *would a
stranger get through this*, and it requires a human learning something they do not know, over real
days. Nothing here fakes it, and no verdict is claimed on its behalf.

What that leaves unmeasured is specific: whether being told *"that criterion was the card's fault,
not yours"* mid-session actually lands as absolution rather than as an excuse, and whether stopping
to repair a card breaks the rhythm of a review queue. Both are prose judgments this release changed,
and both are exactly what the gate exists to catch. Everything mechanical around them — the warning
text, the `doctor` note, the in-session repair, the schedule staying put — was driven end to end in
§5, and the dogfood exercised the agent side.

### Tests

**279 → 295 checks.** All 16 mutation-tested per §4.5 — **15 real on the first attempt, one theatre.**
The fake one asserted that `edit-node` refuses an engine-owned field, using a payload of *only*
`{"fsrs": …}` — which the "nothing to edit" guard already rejects, so reverting the unknown-field
refusal left the check green. §4.5's fourth failure mode, verbatim: *another gate already covers it.*
Rebuilt with the engine-owned field smuggled **alongside** a legitimate one, so the other guard stays
silent and only the refusal under test can fire. 16/16 after the rebuild. The running score in this
file is now 3 fake checks in v0.6, 4 in v0.7, 1 here — and the rate still is not the point; **the
mutation test remains the only thing that has ever caught one.**

That set includes the two checks asserting an **absence** (the detector stays silent), where the
mutation had to *introduce the false positive* rather than break the detector. `probe_gap` is
validated as a closed shape at
ingest: `bool` is an `int` in Python and sails straight through a naive check, so it is excluded by
name.

**And the fuzz gate caught this release's worst bug, in this release's own code.** The new
`doctor` scan built its dedupe key straight out of a hand-editable receipt —
`(r.get("topic"), r.get("node"), c)` — so a `topic` holding a dict made the tuple unhashable:
**302 crashes in 600 states**, in the one command that exists to survive corruption and must never
die of what it exists to find. Every field is coerced before it is hashed or sorted; **0 crashes /
600 states** after. `scripts/fuzz.py` also now randomizes `rubric`, `revised` and `probe_gap`,
because a feature that adds read paths and not their fuzz coverage produces a gate that comes back
green about code it never executed.

Two smaller ones from the same discipline. **`revised` is engine-owned and arrived with both halves
of invariant 4** — stripped from any payload, carried across `--replace` — because `retired` shipped
with *neither* and cost a release; one check pins both so they cannot rot apart. And the missed
`ENGRAM_VERSION` bump went red exactly where §2 says it would.


## 1.9.1 — 2026-07-24 · What the merge gates found

Before merging v1.3–v1.9 to `main`, the two gates that had been skipped across the whole
series were finally run: **§4.6 the adversarial review** (four reviewers over the 5.7k-line
diff) and **§5.5 the agent dogfood** (three, on the flows added since v1.3). Between them
they found **nine HIGH defects**, and the pattern is the one this file keeps recording:
every mechanical gate was green the entire time.

**The badge could be re-licensed by a grader that never sat the exam.** One `canary-pass`,
run under *any* model, permanently disabled both staleness triggers — `export` re-opened
and the dashboard read "grader validated · QWK 1.00" with no failure word anywhere. A canary
now re-licenses only its **own** grader context, only within the audit's own 90-day window,
and an **incomplete** canary cannot pass at all. v1.4's central safety claim was
unenforceable for a release.

**`--extend` orphaned every registered explorable.** A shallow dict comprehension aliased the
carried-forward nodes, so `node.pop("artifact")` deleted the value from the object the
carry-forward then read — and the `.bak` was written *after* the mutation, so the backup
could not recover it. The extend selftest was structurally blind: its fixture had no artifact.

**`retired` was neither stripped nor carried.** A payload could **mint** a retirement
(emptying the due queue and un-gating the capstone, since a retired prerequisite counts as
satisfied), and `--replace` **destroyed** a real one — reverting the learner's own decision
on the graph that is its only record.

**`doctor --fix` renamed files into the live graph path without the lock** — a TOCTOU that
POSIX `rename` turns into a silently clobbered topic.

**`refit --force` rescaled every interval in the account off one receipt** (the floor guarded
only the *reported* fit; the multiplier wrote underneath it) and narrated the 1.5× stretch as
a finding.

**The published npm package omitted `gold/` and `experiments/`** — so for every OpenCode
user the audit chain was dead, `export` permanently refused, and both v1.9 presets missing.
The engine's own selftest detected it (260/269 inside the package); nobody had run it there.

**`stats.relearning.first_vs_latest` compared two different populations** and read as a
paired trend: a fixture whose only twice-looped node got *worse* still printed an
improvement.

**Tier 2 fits four parameters and claims seventeen** — `_fit_loss` never calls the growth
functions, so w[4..16] are invisible to it. **Not fixed here**; the fit is honest at tier 1
and the claim is corrected in the docs. Making tier 2 real needs a replay loss, and is filed
rather than rushed.

**The assessor's documented audit output could not produce a usable audit receipt.** It was
told to omit `rating` — which the engine requires — so `audited_rating`/`agree` never
arrived and `stats.self_grading` sat at zero while audits were being run. `agents/*.md` and
their Codex ports had not changed in seven releases; the parity gate only fires when an agent
file changes, so it had never once run.

Plus: `model --set` validated only the root key (a typo wrote a dead field **and** minted a
`consented` ledger row for a change that never happened); `--kind audit` without
`--audited-rating`, `--attempt` without `--relearn`, and a negative `--cap` were all accepted
silently; the fit acceptance passed a 1.5e-8 "improvement"; the 10-anchor calibration gate had
no minimum count; `--error-class` was accepted on concept and `recalled` items; `--preset`
silently discarded a caller's own design.

**And two things this release says out loud rather than fixing quietly.** The v1.3 entry
claimed the savings curve's peak "independently reproduces" Lindsey's θ ≈ 0.33 — it does not;
the peak sits at a `DUE_MINUTES_BY_R` boundary **this repo chose**, and calling a calibration
coincidence a convergence is exactly the circularity the README warns about for its own gold
set. And the **streak contradiction**: three files banned streak counts while two ordered the
narrator to say one. The instructions to say it are gone.

`scripts/fuzz.py` ships, because the CHANGELOG has been quoting its numbers as measurements
while it lived only on one machine.

### Tests

274 → **279** checks; every fix mutation-tested, three fixtures rewritten after coming back
fake. Fuzz 0/600 + 0/300 on the audit paths. vitest 165/165. **And the package now passes
its own selftest** (279/279 staged from `files`), which is how the missing `gold/` was caught.


## 1.9.0 — 2026-07-24 · The sharper question

The n-of-1 machinery has been randomized, stratified, pre-registered and powered since
v0.9 — and could ask **exactly one question**. The evidence audit then licensed two review-
format changes *as experiments and explicitly not as defaults*, and the engine could not
run either. This closes that gap.

**The metric registry.** Four metrics, each reading its **own** population through the same
shared predicates `stats` uses, so a settled experiment and the dashboard can never tell
two different stories about one learner:

| metric | population | floor/arm |
|---|---|---|
| `first_review_recall` | the node's first genuine review | 15 |
| `retention_7d` | reviews 4–14 days after encoding — the north star's own window | 15 |
| `transfer_fired` | did the capability fire in different clothes | 8 |
| `slip_share` | of classified procedure errors, the slip fraction | 10 |

**A node with no evidence for the chosen metric contributes nothing — never a zero.** "Not
measured" and "measured as a failure" are different facts, and pooling them is the
survivorship bug this repo keeps re-learning. Verified with one receipt log scored four
ways: 6 data points under the recall metrics, **0** under `transfer_fired` (no probe was
ever served) — identical receipts, honestly different answers. **The floor moves with the
metric** too: a rarer population needs the same number of *data points*, which takes longer
to reach, and the engine says so rather than letting a transfer trial settle on the recall
metric's number and call itself powered.

**Two pre-registered designs ship in the repo** (`experiments/*.json`), so *what was
registered* is a checked-in artifact rather than a matter of memory:

- **`probe-variation`** — varied wording vs the stored probe. The direction is well
  evidenced (varied retrieval cues beat constant ones for the *same* target, and the
  benefit compounds with spacing); it has **never** been tested on rubric-graded conceptual
  recall, which is the only thing Engram serves. Both arms are graded by the **blind
  assessor** so the metric's receipts come from one oracle.
- **`topic-reconstruction`** — rebuild the topic's argument skeleton from memory vs the
  ordinary queue. Strong single-session science; **zero** spaced-session studies.

Each names its own **threat to validity** in the file, before any datum exists —
difficulty drift and time-on-task respectively — and a `why_not_a_default` paragraph
saying why it is a question rather than a feature.

### One property got stronger, so a check moved with it

An un-scoreable receipt used to enter an arm as a `None` that every downstream statistic
had to survive. The registry drops it **at the source**: it yields no datum, exactly like
"assigned but not yet reviewed". The v1.0.2-era degradation check was rewritten to pin the
stronger invariant rather than the old one.

### Tests

267 → **269** checks; all four new mutations real after one rewrite — a floor check that
compared two constants (§4.5's "asserts a constant, not a behavior") now starts two real
experiments and reads the floors the engine actually assigned. Fuzz: **0 crashes / 600
states**.


## 1.8.0 — 2026-07-24 · The steering mirror

Engram computes a great deal about a learner and steers on almost none of it. This is the
release where the measurements start steering — and the whole design problem is that **a
system that adapts to you is one hallucinated correlation away from a horoscope.**

**Article 12 joins the constitution:** *every adaptation is proposed by the engine's
numbers, consented by the learner, logged with its evidence, and reversible.* The engine
never infers a trait, and never applies a change itself.

**`propose`** emits at most three adaptations it can justify from this learner's own
receipts, each carrying its `evidence` string and its `grade` (`evidence-backed` /
`model-derived` / `heuristic`). It is **read-only** — verified by a check that hashes the
learner model before and after.

**The families are closed, and that is the entire safety argument.** Adaptivity's evidence
base is mostly a graveyard: learning styles (dead, including "inferred from telemetry" —
the same corpse in ML clothing), the general aptitude-treatment program (dead; prior
knowledge × guidance is the one replicated survivor), chronotype scheduling (>80% of adult
studies find no main effect and no intervention study exists), learner control over method
(measurably *worse* than non-personalized). What Engram is allowed to steer on:

1. **session shape**, from completion telemetry;
2. **assistance level**, from demonstrated prior knowledge — the surviving ATI (expertise
   reversal: assistance helps novices d = +0.505 and *harms* the knowledgeable d = −0.428),
   and only ever proposed upward on clean evidence, because the meta-analysts' own
   asymmetry says assist when unsure;
3. **the workload curve** — and here the engine proposes **no number at all**, only that
   they look at it;
4. **one metacognitive prompt**, specific and fading, because generic prompting at scale is
   a documented null.

**`adaptations`** is the append-only ledger: field, from, to, the evidence, the grade, who
asked, reversible. `/coach` explains current settings *from the ledger* rather than from
memory — *"Sprint has been your default since 30 July, because five of six sessions ended
early. Revert any time."* A change the learner makes themselves is recorded too, marked
`learner`; a no-op writes nothing.

**`rhythms` is retired.** It was defined in the schema, written by nothing, and "read" by
`/coach` for four releases — a promised adaptation surface that could never fire. What
replaces it is **description, not scheduling**: `stats.sessions` reports the learner's own
session pattern with the note that Engram does not schedule by time of day. An existing
model that already carries the key keeps it; new ones never gain it.

### The fuzz earned its place again

Adding `propose` to the `stats` path introduced **472 crashes in 600 fuzzed states** — an
unhashable `topic` in a hand-edited receipt poisoning a dict key, which is the exact shape
`_by_node` was hardened against in v0.6 and which **every new receipt-walking function
re-earns from scratch**. `stats`, the dashboard and therefore `/coach` all went down with
it. Fixed at the gate, and pinned by a check that feeds `propose` an unhashable topic, a
bare integer session, and a dict timestamp.

### Tests

261 → **267** checks; every new check mutation-tested. Two came back fake on the first
pass — a cap that could not bind because only three of four families fired, and a floor
whose fixture qualified either way — both rewritten with fixtures that actually reach the
guard. Fuzz: 472 → **0 crashes / 600 states**.


## 1.7.0 — 2026-07-24 · The open frontier

The founding question asks for a system where a learner can learn **anything, at any level
of mastery**. "Anything" has been true since v1.1. "Any level" was false at both ends: an
expert entering a 20-node topic got a novice's three-node pretest, and a *finished* topic
dead-ended at its capstone with nowhere to go. (The founder's own graphs are hand-titled
"Arc 1 of 2" precisely because the second half had no mechanism.)

**`add-topic --extend` — a topic gains an arc instead of ending.** New nodes only; every
existing node keeps its schedule, receipts and state **byte-for-byte**; new nodes are
stamped with their `arc`; and the capstone re-mints over the union so the build still
requires the whole topic. An id collision is **refused**, not silently merged — re-authoring
a node the learner has receipts for is `--replace`'s job, and confusing the two is how a
learner loses evidence. `/learn` offers it once when the capstone is done.

**`next --frontier-of <node>` — the adaptive pretest, without inventing mastery.** A learner
who says "I know the basics" gets asked a mid-arc probe; if they have it, the engine returns
that node's unreceipted prerequisites, **deepest first**, with their probes. The walk decides
what to **ask** — it credits nothing, advances nothing, and every node it surfaces still
earns its own graded receipt. Skipping without evidence is the same unearned claim as
advancing without evidence, and the constitution does not distinguish them. Bounded at 6
probes per sitting, resumable, declinable.

**`doctor --fix` — the diagnostic finally finishes the sentence.** `doctor` has always named
the problem and stopped, so an unregistered explorable or a quarantined file sat there until
a human happened to read a note. It now emits `fixes` with the exact commands, and `--fix`
applies them **one at a time, validated first**: a quarantined graph is restored only once it
actually parses and only if nothing live occupies its path. There is deliberately **no
`--yes`** — a batch repair of state nobody looked at is how a diagnostic becomes a data-loss
bug.

**Two-phase authoring** (skills): where the platform can spawn background work, `/learn` asks
the architect for a first arc of 4–6 nodes plus an outline, starts teaching immediately, and
lands the rest mid-session with `--extend` — the ~7 minutes of silent terminal that the §5.6
user session called the most likely first-session abandonment point. The capstone is minted
only once the full arc is in, never on a half-map. Platforms without background spawning keep
today's flow and its load-bearing warning line.

### Tests

258 → **261** checks; all six new checks mutation-tested and real on the first pass — the
first release in this series where none came back fake. Fuzz: **0 crashes / 600 states**.


## 1.6.0 — 2026-07-24 · The fitted learner

"Fits your memory" has been **one coarse interval multiplier** since v0.2, and no real user
has ever earned even that. This release makes the claim literal — and, after measuring what
the alternative was worth, deliberately does **not** do the other half the roadmap planned.

**The fitting ladder.** `refit` now fits the model, not just a rescale:

| tier | gate | what it fits |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | ≥50 review receipts | the interval multiplier (unchanged since v0.2) |
| 1 | **64 usable reviews** | the four initial-stability weights, one per first rating |
| 2 | **400 usable reviews** | the whole 17-parameter vector, coordinate descent, hard-clamped |

Every tier ends in **the acceptance check**: a fit ships only if it beats the learner's
current parameters *on the learner's own reviews*. Otherwise `refit` says so and changes
nothing — Anki's "parameters appear optimal" behaviour, and the only thing that makes a
low-n fit safe. Re-running on unchanged evidence is therefore a no-op, by construction.

Stdlib, no framework, and that is not a compromise: production `fsrs-rs` replaced its ML
framework with hand-derived gradients, so a framework-free fit is the shipping norm. What
it needs is the *scaffolding* — bounds, an L1 prior toward the shipped defaults, a
monotonicity repair across ratings, and validation so a hand-edited `fsrs_params` is
clamped rather than trusted into the scheduler.

**`stats.workload` — the trade-off, drawn and never recommended.** Reviews/day and mean
interval at 80/85/90/95% desired retention, computed from the learner's own stabilities,
on the dashboard. **No auto-recommendation**: Anki — holding the largest review dataset in
existence — *removed* its "compute minimum recommended retention" feature in 25.07, and
every implementation needs per-review **duration** telemetry that Engram's receipts do not
carry and could not honestly attribute (a review here is embedded in a tutoring dialogue).
Drawing the curve is honest; naming a point on it would be theatre.

### What this release deliberately does NOT ship, and why

`docs/14` v1.6 planned an **FSRS-6 migration by replay**. It is not here, and the reasoning
is the release's most useful output:

- **The measured benefit for this user base is ~zero.** On the 10k-user benchmark, *fitted*
  FSRS-4.5 (log loss 0.3624) matches or beats *default-parameter* FSRS-6 (0.3664) and
  FSRS-7 (0.3629). Engram's users run near-defaults, so a version bump alone buys them
  nothing anyone could honestly announce. **Fitting is worth about two version upgrades** —
  so this release shipped the fitting.
- **The cost is real.** Migration re-derives every stored `s`/`d` and moves every due date
  on thousands of machines. Risk with no measured benefit is not a trade.
- **The one genuine argument for it is currently moot.** FSRS-6's short-term formula is
  where same-day dynamics *would* live — but v1.5 deliberately excludes relearn rows from
  the model until a validation earns them a place.
- **And the honest blocker:** the 21 default weights would have to be verified against the
  primary source before being written into a scheduler that governs other people's
  memories. Unverified constants are fabricated data, whatever the changelog says.

Measured on the founder's own state while deciding: **13 usable rows** against a tier-1
floor of 64. Nobody is close to fitting yet, which makes shipping the ladder now (and the
migration never-on-a-hunch) the right order.

### The defects this release's gates found — and one is the sharpest yet

- **The S0 fitter was a NO-OP on real receipts**, and it looked like it worked: loss fell a
  hair, output was monotone, and the synthetic instrument test passed. The loss used each
  row's *recorded* `s_before` — computed under the **old** weights — so it never depended
  on the parameters being fitted. Only first reviews can teach S0, and only if their
  stability is recomputed from the candidate. **Found by mutating the tier floor**: removing
  the gate changed nothing, because there was nothing to gate.
- **The L1 prior was calibrated for a summed loss and applied to a mean**, so it outweighed
  the data ~15:1 and the fitter silently never moved. Recovery of a known parameter went
  from 3.79 to **20.25 against a true 20.0** once scaled. Caught by the §5.5 instrument test
  — generate data from known parameters and demand recovery.
- **Four checks came back FAKE across the run** (§4.5): a floor test that passed `--force`
  and therefore bypassed the floor; an acceptance test blocked by the floor instead;
  a fixture with no later reviews; and no check at all asserting the fitted vector
  *reaches the scheduler*. All rewritten. One mutation was **correctly** fake — the
  first-reviews filter is genuinely a no-op optimization, not a correctness guard, and the
  comment now says so instead of overclaiming.

### Tests

253 → **258** checks; every new check mutation-tested. Fuzz: **0 crashes / 600 states**.


## 1.5.0 — 2026-07-24 · The relearning loop

`docs/07` flagged successive relearning in v0.6 as *"the most promising unexploited item in
the retention literature for this codebase"* and ordered it specified against primary
sources before anyone built it. `docs/13` §2.5 is that specification; this is the build.

**The session no longer ends on a failed retrieval.** When a concept or fact comes back
`lapsed`, the tutor re-derives it, puts another item in between (**never** an immediate
re-ask — every protocol that worked used a delay or an intervening item), and asks again,
up to three passes, stopping at **one** correct recall. One, not three: the "relearning
override" is the clearest result in this literature — with spaced relearning to follow, a
higher initial criterion buys almost nothing and costs ~2 minutes a concept.

**The dose is guaranteed rather than hoped for.** The quantity the evidence is actually
about is *spaced sessions in the first weeks*, and FSRS left alone can starve a lucky first
recall of them by booking a long second interval. So the first two post-encode intervals
are capped at **3 and 9 days** (inside the Cepeda ridgeline), which puts ≥3 spaced sessions
inside the 30-day north-star window — then the node **graduates** and FSRS runs untouched.
Verified end to end: 4d → 3d → 9d → 128d.

The numbers, quoted at their honest size: 3 vs 1 relearning sessions is **+60% relative
recall at one month**; one correct recall in each of three spaced sessions beats three
massed into one **68% vs 26%** at a week; and the only *exposure-controlled* study puts the
pure effect at **d ≈ 0.7**, not the d ≈ 4 of confounded designs. Transfer under exposure
control is **≈ 0.15** — this buys durability of the practiced item and we do not claim more.

**What it deliberately does not do:**
- **Procedures are excluded, and the engine refuses the flag on them.** The one direct test
  of this protocol on problem-solving material found "only meager benefits". They keep the
  problem grammar's lapse path.
- **New material only.** A pre-v1.5 node is never retroactively shortened; the caps ride an
  `fsrs.dose` stamp written at first encode. `settings.relearning: "off"` disables the whole
  layer, and an untouched v1.4 state behaves exactly as before.
- **No claim that this is settled.** No published study combines successive relearning with
  an adaptive scheduler; the cap is a labeled **policy layer over FSRS**, not a scheduler
  change, and the payload says so.

### G11 — the live defect this release had to fix first

A same-day re-attempt is a review at `elapsed == 0`, where `retrievability` is **1.0 by
construction**. Left alone, the very behaviour this release asks for would have: strengthened
stability off a 100%-recall prediction, counted as a retention review it is not, and inflated
**both** `predicted` and `observed` in `refit`'s sample — biasing the schedule fit toward
*"your memory is better than the model thinks"*. Upstream FSRS trains on `(i > 1 AND
delta_t > 0)` for exactly this reason.

So `relearn` rows are recorded append-only (receipts-or-it-didn't-happen applies to the
criterion claim too) and excluded from state transitions, from every retention-family
population, and from the fit — by **one line in the shared predicate**, so every reader
inherits it (the v0.6.4 lesson). Legacy same-day rows written before the stamp existed are
caught by an elapsed guard.

**`stats.relearning`** reports loops, criterion-met, and the literature's own efficiency
signature — retries per loop falling as material comes back — **derived at read time** from
each (node, day) group, because the day's first receipt is already on disk when a retry
happens and receipts are never retro-stamped.

### The defects the gates found

- **A fixture's premise died** the moment the dose shipped: a check that needed a "far-out"
  node got a capped one instead. Rewritten to graduate *through* the dose window, which now
  also pins that the caps release a node rather than trapping it.
- **Two new checks came back FAKE** (§4.5, and this is the fourth release running):
  the dose-scoping fixture used a node whose dose window had already passed, so the
  `was_new` guard was never reached; and the `refit` elapsed-guard was untestable because
  the relearn filter had already removed every row the fixture produced. Both rewritten —
  one with a node *inside* the window, one with a hand-written legacy row carrying
  `retrievability: 1.0` and no stamp.

### Tests

249 → **253** checks; all six new checks mutation-tested (two fake, both rewritten).
Fuzz: **0 crashes / 600 states**.


## 1.4.0 — 2026-07-24 · The audited tutor

v0.7 built the audit that measures the blind assessor and shipped it as the project's
central safety claim. It has never measured **the other grader** — and the tutor writes
*every* `/review` receipt and every `error_class` behind `procedure_slip_share`,
in-context, with the dialogue it just ran sitting in front of it. That is the exact
condition the separation of powers exists to distrust, and it was the one grader nothing
checked. Meanwhile the assessor's badge, once earned, was **permanent**.

**Audit receipts persist, and reschedule nothing.** `/review` has spawned the assessor to
spot-audit the tutor's grades since v0.2; the verdict was narrated once and evaporated.
`KINDS` has carried an `audit` slot the whole time with nothing writing it. Now
`rate --kind audit --audited-rating <what the tutor said>` records the comparison as
evidence on disk that touches **no** FSRS state, no node state, no due date, no `reps` —
"audits inform, they don't reschedule" is structural rather than a sentence in a skill
file. `/review` also escalates on **any** `partial` now, not just partial-heavy sessions,
because the mid-band is where graders measurably diverge.

**`stats.self_grading` — the tutor's number, with its limits attached.** Agreement (QWK)
and **signed direction** between the tutor and the blind assessor, banded, with the honest
label in the `read`: *agreement with the blind assessor, whose own validity is what
`/coach audit` measures — tutor validity is bounded by that chain, never better.* No
blindness property is claimed for the tutor and none can be: dialogue context is a
permanent confound. Direction is published because a mean bias of zero is also what
"inflates half, deflates half" looks like.

**The badge expires (v1.4's teeth).** `assessor-audit --grader-context` records *which*
grader earned a verdict; `grader-health --grader-context` compares it to the grader
running today. A mismatch → `stale-model`, `grader_unvalidated: true`, and **`export`
refuses** — because the one published measurement of a silent judge-model swap found it
uniformly **more lenient**, which is this project's single dangerous direction. When the
context is unknowable, age is the fallback (90 days). Naive rolling drift detectors are
deliberately not used: their measured false-alarm rate on drift-free streams is 75%, and a
gate that cries wolf is a gate nobody reads.

**And the cheap way back: the canary.** `gold --canary` emits 15 items chosen the same way
every time — hash-stable, **stratified across all three bands** with the mid-band and this
grader's historically-weak case types oversampled. A clean run re-licenses the badge; a
dirty one demands the full 86×3. **A canary can never mint a `pass`** — its verdict domain
is `canary-pass`/`canary-fail`, enforced in the engine, because otherwise the cheap path
would quietly replace the expensive one.

**Band-stratified audits.** `by_gold_band` reports agreement, signed bias and inflation
count per gold band. The 2026 short-answer literature finds rubric-anchored LLM graders
near-human at the extremes and materially off in the middle — so a healthy pooled QWK can
sit on top of a soft `partial` band, which is exactly where a learner's borderline answers
live.

**The adjudication kit, at last.** Since v0.7 the engine has printed, on every audit, that
its gold set is authored rather than independently adjudicated and that one outside human
would be the highest-value contribution to this repository. [`docs/ADJUDICATION.md`](docs/ADJUDICATION.md)
is the procedure and `adjudication-stats --file` is the procedure in code: a 10-anchor
calibration gate (≥80% exact) that runs **before** any agreement number is trusted, then
exact / QWK / **ordinal Krippendorff's α with a bootstrap CI** / direction counts /
confusion, against thresholds fixed in advance (α ≥ 0.80 corroborated · 0.667–0.80
tentative · below contested). One external rater **corroborates**; replacing the author
would take two independent externals agreeing with each other, and the engine keeps saying
so.

### The defects this release's own gates found

- **The canary was 100% mid-band on the first cut** — structurally blind to a grader that
  had started failing the *clear* cases. A tripwire that can only see one band is not a
  tripwire; it is a narrower badge. Now quota-stratified across all three.
- **A canary audit hijacked "the latest audit."** `_latest_audit` took the newest file, so
  running a canary replaced an 86-item verdict with a 15-item one — and `canary-pass`,
  not being a valid *full* verdict, then read as `unreadable` and **voided a badge that
  was fine**. The cheap path may vouch for the expensive one; it may never overwrite it.
- **`export` did not inherit staleness** until it was given its own `--grader-context`.
  Contributing to a shared corpus is precisely where a badge nobody re-earned matters most.
- **The fuzz found a brick in the adjudication reader**: `{"a":1} in GOLD_SCORE` raises
  `unhashable type` rather than returning False — 35 crashes in 300 states, in a read path
  whose entire job is surviving a human's hand-authored file.
- **One new check came back FAKE** (§4.5): the guard keeping audit receipts out of
  `_by_node` was mutation-tested green, because the fixture always had the audit arrive
  *last* and never reached the line. The case the guard exists for — an audit as a node's
  **first** receipt, which would invent an encoding event that never happened — is now
  asserted directly.

### Numbers audit (§4.8)

`self_grading` fails **pessimistically by construction** (a missed audit shows as a
smaller `n`, never as agreement) and its denominators are named: `n` is spot-audits, the
band rows carry their own. Below 20 audits it publishes **counts only** — never a rate.
`by_gold_band`'s counts are *judgments* (items × runs) and say so, keeping `items` and
`judgments` in separate keys (bug class #7). `grader_context` is **stored verbatim, never
inferred** — a model naming its own weights is fabricated data, and `"unknown"` is honest.
The staleness flag is *derived* from the verdict and the context, never read from a file.

### Tests

243 → **249** checks; every new check mutation-tested (one came back fake and was
rewritten — see above). Fuzz: **0 crashes / 600 states** on the standard read paths, plus
a new 300-state sweep over garbage audit files and hand-authored adjudication input
(35 → 0 after the fix).


## 1.3.0 — 2026-07-24 · The kept word

The first release on the road to 2.0 (`docs/14`), and it is the return release: the
binding constraint has been adherence since `docs/08` was written, and three of the four
things this ships were *already in the schema, computed by nothing*.

**The commitment is finally shown back.** `commit` has written the learner's if-then plan
since v0.6 and **no surface has ever displayed it** — the `transfer_probe` defect, repeated
on the strongest licensed adherence lever in the repo. What the direct RCTs actually tested
is the *read-back* (Messmer 2022; Prestwich 2010), not the storing. The session hook now
prints it, and `/review`'s amnesty block shows it once on return, in the learner's own words
— rationed by exactly the decay line's return-event rule (never-closed loop, or a real
absence), because a sentence you wrote becomes nagging the moment it greets you daily.
Their text is printed as an inert quoted literal: hook output is injected into an agent's
context, so a commitment reading *"ignore previous instructions"* must arrive as text.
`commit` also stamps renewals and emits `age_days`, which is what drives the keep/rephrase/
drop offer at a seam (the ~28-day cadence is labeled inference, not evidence).

**The capped session stops serving the worst-ranked order.** `due --cap N` ranks by
expected 30-day retention saved per expected minute; `--limit` is untouched and still emits
the bare list in the old most-overdue-first order, so an older skill file against a newer
engine gets byte-identical behavior. Uncapped queues are unchanged.

> **The roadmap's own formula did the opposite of what its prose claimed, and the fixture
> built to make the two orders diverge is the only reason we know.** `docs/14` asserted that

**`retire` — the autonomy verb Engram never had.** Take something off your list: out of
`due`, `next`, `decay`, transfer candidates and the frontier; **counted in every denominator
it leaves** (`adherence.loop_closure.retired_excluded`, `retention.unmeasured.retired`,
`funnel.nodes_retired`, and a line on the dashboard). It is deliberately *not* a `state`
value — a fourth state would ripple through every state reader, and the capstone requires
every node, so retirement would have blocked the build forever. Instead: an engine-owned
block plus one shared `is_retired` predicate, and a **retired prerequisite counts as
satisfied**, so retiring something opens the frontier rather than sealing the topic.
**The engine never proposes retiring a specific node** — auto-retiring whatever a learner
keeps failing is a flattering denominator wearing a helpful face.

**The hook now opens with amnesty — and the reason it does is the most useful thing this
release found.** The first cut of the plan line printed it *after* the decay cost, so the
ambient surface read: **count → what it's costing you → your own unkept promise**, with no
amnesty anywhere, fired automatically before `/review` is typed. Every engine gate was green.
The §5.5 dogfood — an uncontaminated agent handed only the skill file and a seeded state —
read that sequence cold and named it: *"cost-of-decay followed by their own unkept promise,
with no amnesty before it, at the exact moment the protocol says the learner is most likely
to churn. Read cold, that pair is a debt collector, and it ships enabled by default."*
`/review`'s protocol has always guaranteed *nothing owed → what it costs → a path*, and the
skill **cannot repair an ordering violation that happens before it runs**. So the guarantee
now lives in the hook: amnesty first (dated when session history allows), then their plan,
then the cost. The ordering is pinned by a selftest, because a check that merely asserts the
lines exist cannot see the defect.

**The hook stops presenting the wall.** Above `2 × the review cap` (or on the Focus
profile), the ambient line leads with a path that fits and still states the full count:
*"28 reviews due · /review quick clears the 5 most urgent (~3 min) · full queue ~17 min."*
The amnesty protocol existed only inside `/review`; the line that reached the learner first
was the wall it was written to prevent.

Also: `/coach` offers the grader audit **once**, when there are ≥20 receipts and it would
change something (the founder's own machine has 42 receipts and every number stamped
unearned); `/learn` may suggest — once, declinably — anchoring a clock-time cue to an
existing routine (event cues build habits, time cues measurably don't); `/review` carries
one honest line about automaticity taking ~2 months with a huge range, and **no day count,
ever** — the constant does not exist and a countdown is a streak with better manners.

### Numbers audit (§4.8)

`savings_per_min` fails **pessimistically** (a mis-ranked item is still a due item, and the
cap is a floor not a target); its denominator is *expected minutes*, published per item
beside it; `order_basis` ships inside the payload. `retired_excluded` is the one number here
that could flatter — a learner who retires everything unreviewed drives `loop_closure` up —
so the count travels with the rate, reaches the `read` string, and `/coach` is instructed to
voice it. `retired` is reported **beside** `states`, never inside it: the three state counts
still sum to the node total, because two populations may not share a container (bug class
#7). Cross-consistency verified live on one state: `retention.unmeasured.projected_recall_now`,
`decay.now.mean_recall_due` and every `due --cap` item's `r_now` agree to the digit (0.49).

### Tests

234 → **243** checks; every new check mutation-tested (each fails when, and only when, its
own fix is reverted). **Two mutations came back FAKE and were rewritten** — one asserted the
amnesty existed without ever reaching the branch that dates it, which is §4.5's "the fixture
returns before execution reaches the code under test", exactly as the protocol predicts. Fuzz re-run after the last commit:
**0 crashes / 600 states / 19,800 read calls** with `retired` randomized to every JSON type.


## 1.2.2 — 2026-07-22 · closing the review's MED/LOW tail, and one the fuzz found

v1.2.1 fixed the two HIGH defects and left four smaller findings open. Three were real on
1.2.1 and are fixed here; one had already been closed by the 1.2.1 locator rewrite. Fixing
them surfaced a fifth that no reviewer had seen.

- **A version-less `<!-- engram -->` marker was invisible to the filters.** `OPEN_RE` demanded
  a version, so a user who tidied the marker by hand got the worst of both: the block was
  **committed verbatim** on `git add`, and a **second copy prepended** on checkout. The model
  then received the instructions twice and every commit carried a KB of Engram text. The
  version is optional now, in both filters and in `install.ts`.
- **Installing over a tracked `AGENTS.md` dirtied the user's file.** `writeOrPrependAgentsMd`
  laid the block down as `block + "\n\n" + existing` while the smudge filter writes
  `template + content`. The two blank lines survived `clean`, so the bytes handed back to git
  differed from what the user had committed and their file showed modified with a diff they
  never wrote. Install now matches smudge exactly.
- **CRLF files gained blank lines at the seam on every version bump.** The strip was `/^\n+/`,
  which cannot see a CRLF blank line — its first character is `\r`. An LF file got a one-line
  seam, a CRLF file got three.
- **MED 6 as originally reported (a permanently-dirty file) was already gone**, closed by the
  1.2.1 locator rewrite. Verified rather than assumed before it was ticked off.

### The one the fuzz found

`clean` removed **one** block per invocation. Stacked markers — exactly what the version-less
marker bug produced by prepending a second block — left another complete block behind, and git
runs the clean filter **once** per staging. So a file with two blocks committed with one still
in it. `clean` now strips every block in a single pass; each iteration removes at least two
marker lines, so it terminates. Nothing outside a marker pair is touched.

Fuzz on this release, 1500 states across six seeds under `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`: **0 crashes,
0 states with no block on disk, 0 leaked to git, 0 duplicated, 0 non-idempotent, 0 roundtrip
failures.**

### Tests

160 → 165 vitest checks; `selftest` unchanged at 234.

**A second fake check, caught by the same gate as the first.** The LOW-7 check asserted "the
seam does not GROW across bumps" — which was true under both the old and new strip, so it
passed with the fix reverted. The property that actually separates them is that a CRLF file
and an LF file get the *same* seam; rewritten that way it fails correctly (CRLF 3, LF 1). Two
fake checks in two releases is the rate §4.5 warns about, and both were invisible until the

## 1.2.1 — 2026-07-22 · what §7.5 found in v1.2.0, forty minutes later

v1.2.0 shipped with every gate green and **two HIGH defects of the exact class it was cut to
fix**. Both were found by the adversarial review (§4.6) reporting *after* the tag was pushed.
npm was never published, so no installer received them; the tag and GitHub release did.

Measured on the shipped v1.2.0 filters, 1000 generated states under `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`:
**376 crashes, 99 states left with no block on disk, 1 leaking the block into git.**
The same fuzz on this release: **0, 0, 0.**

### The two HIGH defects

- **`clean` and `smudge` disagreed about what a block is.** `clean` required an opening AND a
  closing marker; `smudge` was satisfied by an opening one. Any `AGENTS.md` holding an unmatched
  open marker — a user quoting Engram's own syntax at line start — made `smudge` no-op, so the
  block was **never restored on checkout and Engram's instructions silently stopped reaching the
  model.** That is v1.1.1's bug, reintroduced one function over, in the release that fixed it.
  The two now share one byte-identical locator and a check asserts they cannot drift.
- **One non-UTF-8 byte disabled the filter and leaked the block into git.** Both scripts used
  `sys.stdin.read()`, which is strict UTF-8 under any `*.UTF-8` locale — the macOS Terminal and
  Linux desktop default. A single latin-1 byte raised `UnicodeDecodeError`; git reported
  *"external filter failed"*, fell back to **unfiltered** content, and committed `AGENTS.md`
  with the full Engram block in it, on every `git add` and every `git checkout` thereafter.
  Both filters now read and write **bytes**, decoding with `surrogateescape`, so arbitrary
  byte sequences round-trip untouched.

### Also fixed

- **Mixed line endings were rewritten wholesale.** One CRLF line anywhere converted the entire
  file, contradicting the script's own docstring. The markers now tolerate an optional CR
  instead of the document being normalised.
- **An orphan `<!-- /engram -->` above the block disabled the filter entirely.** The locator took
  the first closing marker outright; with no opening marker before it, it returned "no block"
  and committed the whole thing verbatim. It now takes the first close that *has* an open
  before it.

### Why the v1.2.0 gates missed both

Worth writing down, because the gates were run and were green.

- **The fuzz asserted the wrong property.** It checked `clean(smudge(x)) == x` — roundtrip
  stability, which stops the file reading as permanently dirty. It never checked contract 1,
  *"the block is on disk"*. HIGH 1 satisfies roundtrip perfectly: smudge no-ops, clean no-ops,
  the value is stable — and the instructions are gone. A stable wrong answer passes a stability
  check.
- **The environment hid HIGH 2.** Every filter run during v1.2.0's gates had `LANG` unset, so
  Python used `surrogateescape` and the latin-1 byte sailed through. Under any desktop locale it
  raised. **A gate that passes because of an unset environment variable has not run.** The fuzz
  now pins `LC_ALL` explicitly.
- **Two unit checks were asserting the bugs.** `opencode-engram-smudge passes through when
  content already has marker` fed an *unmatched* opening marker and asserted pass-through —
  that is HIGH 1, written down as the expected result. It went green through the whole release.

### Tests

155 → 160 vitest checks; `selftest` unchanged at 234. The shared locator is duplicated in both
filters rather than imported: an import is one more file that can go missing, and v1.2.0 proved
what a crashing filter costs. A check asserts the two copies are byte-identical.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-07-22 · AGENTS.md, and the instructions that deleted themselves

The OpenCode plugin wrote its model instructions to `.opencode/instructions.md` and registered
that path in `cfg.instructions`. That only ever worked on OpenCode's v1 session path; the v2
runner (`packages/core/src/instruction-context.ts`) discovers `AGENTS.md` natively and never
reads `cfg.instructions` at all. So the instructions were one refactor away from silently not
loading. #11 (thanks @luanweslley77) moves them into `AGENTS.md`, behind a versioned
`<!-- engram v… -->` marker.

**The first implementation of that move deleted the instructions it existed to install** — and
it took an end-to-end test against a real OpenCode to see it, because every unit test passed.

### Packaging

- **A pre-commit hook stripped the block from the working tree, not just from the commit.**
  The design was "always on disk, never in git". The strip script rewrote the file in place, so
  after one `git commit` the block was gone from disk too — and `selfExtract` returns early when
  the version is unchanged, so nothing put it back until the next release. Measured on OpenCode
  1.18.4: a project with a `CLAUDE.md` went from *"Instructions from: CLAUDE.md"* to a **0-byte
  `AGENTS.md` and no instructions block at all**, permanently. Replaced with a git
  **clean/smudge filter pair** — `clean` strips the block on the way into the index, `smudge`
  restores it on checkout. The working tree always has it; git never does.
- **The hook also swept unstaged work into commits.** `git add AGENTS.md` after stripping
  staged the whole file, so anyone using `git add -p` on it committed hunks they had held back.
  Gone with the hook.
- **A project-root `AGENTS.md` silently suppresses the user's `CLAUDE.md`.** Not our bug, but
  ours to disclose: OpenCode's `instruction.ts:122-133` breaks on the first *filename* that
  matches anywhere in the ancestor chain, and `AGENTS.md` is first in that list. Creating one
  takes `CLAUDE.md` away, and `findUp` tests existence, so even an empty `AGENTS.md` does it.
  Engram now warns when both exist. **The warning fires from the config hook, once per session,
  not from `selfExtract`** — a `CLAUDE.md` added the week after install would otherwise never
  be flagged, which is precisely the case the warning is for.
- **`.git/info/exclude` no longer hides the user's own rules.** Keeping `AGENTS.md` out of git
  is right while the file holds only Engram's block, and a trap the moment it doesn't: the
  exclude is invisible from the working tree — it is not `.gitignore`, and finding it takes
  `git check-ignore -v` — so `git status` stays silent and the user's rules are never committed.
  The entry now tracks **content, not authorship**: present while Engram-only, removed as soon
  as there is anything else in the file, with a log line saying so. `.opencode/` is deliberately
  *not* excluded — it can hold the user's own commands and agents, and hiding those would be the
  same bug.
- **The clean and smudge filters disagreed about what a block is.** `clean` was line-anchored;
  `smudge` used a substring test. A user whose rules merely mention `<!-- engram v` inline made
  `smudge` no-op, so the block was never restored on checkout and the instructions quietly
  stopped reaching the model. Both are anchored now, and a check holds them together.
- **The clean filter could delete user prose above the block.** The old regex was `DOTALL` with
  no `$`, so `.+?` crossed newlines: a line mentioning the marker swallowed everything down to
  the real close marker — and the truncated file is what git stored. The locator now takes the
  **last** opening marker before the closing one, both anchored alone on their line.
- **The clean filter no longer rewrites the user's line endings.** It normalized CRLF→LF across
  the whole file, user content included. CRLF is now normalized only for matching and restored
  on the way out.
- `cfg.instructions` is no longer set. Once the file is `AGENTS.md` at project root, v1
  discovers it natively (and de-duplicates against config — `instruction.ts:113` is a `Set`), and
  v2 never reads the field. It was dead either way.
- Legacy `.opencode/instructions.md` is removed on upgrade.

### Tests

110 → 155 vitest checks; `selftest` unchanged at 234 (the engine is untouched).

The filter pair was fuzzed at 600 generated `AGENTS.md` states across three seeds.
`clean(smudge(x)) == x` holds 600/600 for every value `clean` itself produces — the invariant
the system actually maintains, so the file never reads as permanently dirty. A block that
reached git wrongly (possible via the `else cat` fallback, when a commit lands before
extraction) **converges to a fixed point in one pass in 122/122 cases, with no oscillation**;
it shows up as a one-time diff removing the block, which is the repo being corrected. Nothing
outside the block was lost in 900 cases. `opencode-engram-clean`'s docstring records this so
the one-time diff does not read as a bug later.

Four checks cover `.git/info/exclude` specifically, because `syncAgentsExclude` rewrites a
user-owned file by splitting and rejoining lines: user comments, blank lines, ordering and
negation patterns all survive; 25 consecutive sessions produce byte-identical output with no
duplicate entries; and a `.git` that is a *file* (worktree, submodule) no-ops instead of
throwing.

**One of the new checks was fake, and the mutation gate caught it** — §4.5, for the fourth
release running. The fixture for "user prose above the block survives" used an *inline* mention,
which the anchored regex never matches, so `opens[0]` and `opens[-1]` were the same element and
flipping between them changed nothing. Rewritten with two genuinely-anchored markers so the two
definitions diverge. Worth recording that the `$`-anchor and the last-marker rule are
belt-and-braces: either alone saves the inline case, so only the fenced-example fixture
separates them, and the locator has to be mutation-tested as a unit. The test file says so.

## 1.1.1 — 2026-07-22 · What the post-release review found, three hours later

v1.1.0 shipped with every gate green. §7.5 — an independent reviewer reading the **shipped**
code with one standing instruction, *"find a number that is wrong, especially one wrong in
the direction that reassures the learner"* — found **two HIGH defects of exactly that class**,
plus four more. Every one is a number a learner would have believed.

- **The `fact` bar had no floor and drew 100% off a single review.** v1.1.0 fixed precisely
  this bug for the `concept`/`procedure` bars — by gating them on `read`, which is computed
  from *procedure vs concept only*. The `fact` arm, which `read` never looks at, sailed
  through the gate one line further down. The v1.1.0 selftest could not see it because its
  fixture built no fact nodes. **Every arm now carries its own floor**; sub-floor kinds are
  listed as counts.
- **`procedure_slip_share`'s floor counted judgments, not nodes.** One procedure node the
  learner had failed **five times running** supplied the whole denominator, and the page
  read *"100% were execution slips"* — the single most flattering sentence available about
  a node that keeps dying, printed directly beside a recall rate the same page had just
  suppressed for want of data. The floor now counts **distinct nodes** (`n_nodes` ships
  beside `n_classified`), and both narrators gate on it.
- **The circularity caveat understated the author's own concessions** — hardcoded "5 items
  were corrected" while the shipped gold carried **6**, the sixth being the one corrected
  *because all three grader runs disagreed*. The string that exists to disclose the
  instrument's contamination was itself contaminated, in the flattering direction. Now
  derived from the file. The adversarial-share figure in `bias_note` was likewise stale
  (88%, from the 66-item era; the shipped set is 86%) and is now computed.
- **The wrong-core grading rule reached 2 of the 3 rulebooks — and missed the one that
  matters most.** Traced through the shipped skills: the assessor only ever writes `encode`
  receipts, so **every `review` receipt carrying `error_class` — the entire denominator of
  `procedure_slip_share` — is written by the /review tutor**, grading from
  `problem-grammar.md`, which lacked the rule. The tutor is also the one grader `/coach
  audit` never measures. Both shared grammars now carry it, and say so.
- **`export` stamped the audited assessor's QWK on tutor-graded receipts.** v1.1 made this
  material by exporting `error_class`, a tutor-only field. A corpus consumer would have read
  one oracle's measured validity across two populations, one of which nothing has ever
  audited. `grader_qwk` is now null where no audited grader signed the verdict, and each
  receipt carries `self_graded`.
- **`add-topic --replace` silently demoted procedure → concept.** A re-authored payload that
  forgot `kind` stopped /review serving fresh instances, and a tutor still passing
  `--error-class` wrote receipts stamped `concept` carrying a slip. It now warns, as every
  other reclassification in that function already did.

Selftest 230 → **234**, every new check mutation-tested; fuzz re-run clean (0 / 600).

**The lesson, which is the same one every time:** the gate that catches a bug class will not
catch that bug class in itself. v1.1.0's dashboard-floor fix shipped a dashboard-floor bug
one line away, and its slip-share fix shipped a slip-share denominator bug. Only the reviewer
who did not write the code saw either.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-07-22 · The procedure layer — practice what must be performed

Engram could teach *why* and could not teach *doing*. Every node was a declarative claim,
every probe verbal free recall, every receipt graded prose — which converts "differentiate
this" into "recite how differentiation works," and the transfer literature prices that
conversion at half the effect or, without elaborated feedback, near zero (Pan & Rickard
2018: congruent d = 0.58, incongruent 0.28, neither-condition ≈ 0 bias-adjusted). v1.1
adds the third knowledge kind. **Engram stays a general learn-anything system** — the kind
is declared per node by the content (a `procedure` is a git workflow or a conjugation as
readily as an integral); there is no math mode, and a topic with zero procedure nodes
behaves exactly as on v1.0.8 — same schedule, same grades, same flow. (Precisely, not
byte-identically: new receipts carry a `node_kind` stamp, `due` gains two additive keys,
`stats` gains `by_kind` — additions old code paths never read.)

**Theory (docs/11 + docs/12).** Two new pillars, adversarially verified before code: three
independent refute-first passes over the acquisition, retention, and grading literature
(ten full-text reads) **corrected five claims, deflated two effect sizes to their adult
magnitudes, and inverted one design rule** — the honest parts are in docs/11 §Method,
including the ones that made the first draft wrong: interleaved-math d = 0.83 is a
7th-grade number (adults: g ≈ 0.3–0.4); "always serve fresh isomorphs" was backwards
(retention lives in *algorithmic variants* — new values, same structure; re-clothed
isomorphs stay with `transfer_probe`); and the erroneous-example novice gate did not
survive its replication literature (rewritten: after instruction, always scaffolded, never
a default).

**Engine (`scripts/engram.py`, all additive, zero migration).** Node `kind`
(`concept|procedure|fact`) + `practice` blocks stored under the `viz` opaque-metadata
covenant with warn-don't-die validation; `node_kind` stamped on receipts at grading time
(the `artifact`-stamp discipline); `error_class` (`conceptual|slip`) validated at ingest,
carried on receipts, `rate --error-class`; `due` payload carries `node_kind` + `practice`;
`stats.by_kind` (first-review recall per kind, the modality mold: same predicates, honest
floor, confound caveat *inside the payload*, slip share with its own `n_classified`
denominator); dashboard "Knowledge kinds" section (the caveat reaches the page); export
gains `node_kind`/`error_class` as closed enums. Selftest 217 → **230**, every new check
mutation-tested (11/11 fail when their fix is reverted).

**Behavior (skills + agents).** New `skills/_shared/problem-grammar.md`: the worked-example
ladder (study → complete → faded → cold solve, faded step = the principle-bearing one,
pace from measured state), fresh algorithmic variants with **answer keys computed by
execution — never inspection** (generated-problem pipelines carry a measured ~3–5%
wrong-key rate even with execution checks), the discrimination beat (confusable
`discriminates_from` siblings served adjacently — juxtaposition carries the interleaving
effect: g 0.73 adjacent vs 0.22 scattered), slip ≠ lapse pricing, and the scaffolded
erroneous-example rung. The architect declares kinds + practice frames and seeds error
banks from documented misconception catalogs (FCI, DIRECT, CAOS/SCI, natural-number bias,
progmiscon.org). The assessor gains the execution duty and `error_class`, with
right-answer-wrong-method capped at `partial` — the step-graded LLM literature is bimodal,
and reference-plus-engineered-rubric is the configuration that reaches human parity.

**The grader is measured on solutions before its solution verdicts count — and the
measurement bit back.** The gold set grows 66 → **86** (20 adversarial procedure items:
right-answer-wrong-method, slip-vs-conceptual both directions, fluent-wrong-step,
terse-but-correct-solution, alternate-valid-method, clean/lapsed/boundary anchors — every
number verified by execution at authoring time).

Extending the set falsified the badge. **v0.7's "0 of 198 · it has never once inflated a
grade" did not survive**: three audits over **774 judgments** caught **3 real inflations**,
and both root causes were ambiguities in the grader's *own instructions* —

- `cap at partial` was read as an instruction to **award** partial rather than to limit it
  (one run wrote "MISSED" against all three criteria and then graded `partial`);
- the right-answer-wrong-method tiebreak **this release introduced** generalized into a
  universal criteria-counting rule that overrode `lapsed = core absent or wrong`.

Both are closed; the shipping spec measures **0 inflations in 258 judgments**, and the badge
now reads `0/258` with that history stated rather than hidden. Every fix made the grader
*stricter*, so agreement with the author fell as safety rose (QWK 0.983 → 0.964) — and the
two categories where all three runs now disagree with the author are **left contested on
purpose**, because three rounds of conceding to your own instrument is not adjudication.
Full account: [`docs/release-audits/v1.1.0-grader-audit.md`](docs/release-audits/v1.1.0-grader-audit.md).

**Still honestly open** (docs/11 §7): FSRS has no published validation on procedural skill
(DAS3H is the citable precedent; `by_kind` is the per-learner instrument); slip pricing is
a labeled engineering inference, now n-of-1-testable; nobody anywhere has published a
delayed-retention math-tutoring RCT — the Commons question extends to procedures.

## 1.0.8 — 2026-07-19 · OpenClaw — the sixth platform, and the tutor leaves the terminal

Engram now installs on **[OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai)**, the self-hosted gateway
that fronts an agent with Discord, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, and Signal. Every
claim below was verified against a live **2026.7.1-2** install on macOS, under an isolated
`OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` so nothing touched a real gateway or a real learning store.

This is the first platform where `/review` happens on a phone. The FSRS schedule has always
booked reviews for moments you are not at a desk; until now the tool only existed at one.

- **One command:** `openclaw plugins install engram --marketplace nagisanzenin/engram`.
  OpenClaw reads engram's existing Claude-compatible `marketplace.json` straight from
  GitHub — no new manifest, no ClawHub publish. `/learn`, `/review`, and `/coach` register
  as slash commands on every OpenClaw surface.

- **Packaging: the `hooks` key was aimed at a file, and the capability report hid it.**
  OpenClaw matches `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` *before* every other marker, so engram is
  always a Codex bundle there — and for Codex bundles it reads the manifest's `hooks` value
  as a list of **directories to scan for hook packs**. Engram declared
  `"hooks": "./hooks/hooks.json"`, so the scanner was pointed at a *file*, found no
  `*/HOOK.md`, and loaded nothing — while `plugins inspect` still cheerfully reported
  `hooks` among the bundle capabilities. Declared-and-broken looked exactly like working.
  The key is now **removed**, which is also the more correct manifest: OpenAI documents
  that Codex auto-discovers `./hooks/hooks.json` when no `hooks` entry is present, so the
  key was redundant on the platform it was written for. Both platforms now fall back to
  their own documented conventions and both find their hooks.

- **The nudge, ported as a hook pack** (`hooks/engram-due/` — `HOOK.md` + `handler.js`).
  It binds to `command:new` and `command:reset` because those are the only two internal
  hook events whose `event.messages` OpenClaw routes back to the conversation; the
  `session:*` events exist but discard pushed output. Same contract as every other
  platform: forwards what `engram.py session-start` prints, composes nothing itself, and
  degrades to silence on missing `python3`, missing engine, non-zero exit, timeout, or
  oversized output.

- **A silent-failure trap worth naming, because it is the kind that reads as success.**
  OpenClaw skips internal hook discovery entirely until something opts in, and shipping a
  hook pack inside a plugin does *not* opt in. Without
  `openclaw config set hooks.internal.enabled true`, `openclaw hooks list` shows
  `engram-due ✓ ready` — correct events, requirements satisfied, green tick — and the hook
  never runs once. Proven both ways in the gateway loader log: **zero** internal handlers
  registered without the flag, `Registered hook: engram-due -> command:new, command:reset`
  with it. The install doc leads with this rather than burying it in troubleshooting.

- **The assessor stays blind, structurally.** No OpenClaw bundle format maps an `agents/`
  directory into a usable registry — Claude-format bundles detect `agents` and explicitly
  decline to execute them — so engram's three agents are not registered here. They are
  spawned instead through `sessions_spawn`, whose default `context: "isolated"` starts the
  child with a clean transcript: it sees the task text and nothing else of the tutoring
  conversation. That is the assessor's blindness requirement met by construction rather
  than by politeness. New `skills/_shared/subagents.md` carries the contract — children
  read `agents/<name>.md` from the installed plugin rather than receiving an inlined copy,
  so there remains exactly one definition of each agent across all six platforms, and it
  states plainly that if `sessions_spawn` is absent under a narrow tool profile there is no
  degraded mode: engram does not let the tutor grade its own learner.

- **The engine-resolution snippet was rewritten because a live model got it wrong.** The
  first port added OpenClaw as a second line — `[ -f "$ENGRAM" ] || ENGRAM="…"` after the
  existing nested-default expression. A live `/review` then failed with
  `Exec failed: python3 $HOME/.openclaw/extensions/engram/scripts/engram.py`: the model had
  read two lines of shell and *paraphrased* them into one guessed path, and the guess was
  wrong under a non-default state dir. `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` was verified present in the
  exec environment, so this was not a missing variable — it was a snippet that invited
  improvisation. All three skills now carry one copy-and-run `for` loop over the candidate
  roots, each guarded by an existence check, prefixed *"RUN THIS BLOCK VERBATIM — do not
  substitute a path you guessed."* This also hardens the other five platforms: the old form
  took the first *set* variable even when nothing was there, the new one takes the first
  root that actually **exists**. Verified identical across bash, zsh, and POSIX sh, and
  under each platform's env layout.

- **And then that rewrite introduced its own regression, caught by a blind agent read.**
  The first draft ended in `: "${ENGRAM:?engram engine not found…}"`. In a **dev clone** —
  no plugin-root variable set, which is exactly how contributors run this repo — nothing
  matched, and `:?` **aborts the shell**, killing the rest of the block. The old code failed
  softer there and let the skill's prose fallback recover. Two fixes: `$PWD` and
  `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` are now the final candidates (so a dev clone resolves at
  all, which the old chain never did either), and the hard `:?` became a non-fatal warning
  on stderr. The finding came from handing the edited files to an uncontaminated agent and
  asking only *"which mechanism applies to you, and does the block succeed?"* — a question
  no test in this repo asks.

- **Known ordering caveat, unchanged from previous releases and deliberately left alone:**
  the Antigravity staging path is checked *before* `$PWD`, so on a machine carrying a stale
  Antigravity install, a dev clone will silently run the installed engine rather than the
  checkout. Reordering would change resolution behavior on a supported platform to fix a
  contributor-only papercut, which is the wrong trade in a release whose whole claim is
  "no regressions elsewhere."

- **The cross-platform prose was made platform-agnostic after a pollution check.** The
  first draft wrote *"On OpenClaw, engram's agents are not registered — call
  `sessions_spawn`…"* into all three **shared** skills, which every platform's agent reads.
  A blind agent test flagged the branch as stated in terms of two platforms with Claude
  Code's own `Agent`/Task tool never named, and noted the skills use bare agent names where
  that platform requires a namespaced `engram:engram-assessor`. Rewritten to describe the
  *property* — "a fresh-context child running that agent's definition" — and to name both
  mechanisms. Re-tested blind: correct tool, correct namespaced type, three separate
  spawns for the audit, and no ambiguity reported.

- **Verified live, not merely wired.** Driven against `gpt-5.4` with `ENGRAM_HOME` pointed
  at a throwaway store: a model asked to name its learning skills answered
  `coach`/`learn`/`review`; `/review` and `/coach` produced real output end-to-end; the
  hook was observed on a live `/new` resolving the engine and pushing the 217-character
  nudge; and the assessor round-trip completed — an isolated child read
  `agents/engram-assessor.md` and returned a valid receipt (`recalled`/`easy`, `rubric_notes`
  quoting both criteria). **The child's prompt was read out of the trajectory log and
  contained only the task text** — the blindness claim is now evidence, not architecture.
  A negative case landed too: pointed at a missing instructions file the child returned
  `{"status":"blocked"}` and declined to grade rather than inventing a verdict.

- **Still not claimed:** delivery of the nudge into a real chat surface. The push onto
  `event.messages` is proven; routing needs a connected channel, and the CLI `agent` path
  has no conversation to reply into. `/learn` end-to-end and the artifact smith are also
  unverified. §5.6 discipline: the unverified list ships with the release.

- **A testing note worth writing down, because it produced a false negative for three
  rounds.** `pkill -f "openclaw.mjs gateway run"` matches nothing — the Gateway renames its
  process to `openclaw-gateway`. Three consecutive "the hook never fires" results were
  actually the *original* gateway still holding the port and serving a stale copy of the
  handler; the new instrumented process was exiting on `Port already in use` while its log
  scrolled past unread. The hook had been firing correctly the whole time. Stop it with
  `openclaw gateway stop` or by PID, and check that the port is free before concluding
  anything about a hook.

- Upstream discrepancy, reported here for the next reader: OpenClaw's own
  `docs/plugins/bundles.md` states native manifests win detection ("If a directory contains
  both, OpenClaw uses the native path"), but the shipped `detectBundleManifestFormat`
  checks `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` first and only reaches `openclaw.plugin.json` fourth.
  An `openclaw.plugin.json` was written, tested, observed to be inert, and **deliberately
  not shipped** — it would do nothing today and would silently change engram's plugin shape
  the day upstream makes the code match the docs.

- **The adversarial pass found one of its own release's claims to be false.** `HOOK.md` said
  *"Every failure path degrades to silence"* — but only the **engine** call was inside a
  `try`. Delivery was not: `event.messages.push(...)` throws if `messages` is frozen, absent,
  or not an array, and a thrown handler is not a silent one. Two mitigating facts, both
  verified in OpenClaw's shipped source: `triggerInternalHook` wraps every handler in
  try/catch and logs, so this could never break a session; and `createInternalHookEvent`
  always supplies a real extensible array, so the normal path cannot reach it. Severity is
  therefore low — but *"the host catches my exception"* is not silence, it is a line in an
  operator's error log, and a hook that advertises silence should not be relying on its host
  to keep that promise. Delivery is now guarded too, which makes the documented contract true
  unconditionally rather than by courtesy of the runtime. Found by attacking the handler with
  frozen/absent/non-array `messages` and a throwing `push` — cases the earlier unit test
  missed because it ran against an *empty* store, where the handler returns before ever
  reaching delivery. **A negative test that exits early proves nothing about the code past the
  exit.**

- **Gates.** Selftest **217/217** (unchanged — no engine behavior changed, so no new check was
  owed; §4.5 mutation-testing is therefore N/A this release). OpenCode suite **88/88**. Fuzz
  gate re-run against the final commit across every read path enumerated from the dispatch
  table plus the read-only sub-actions the table cannot see: **0 crashes / 500 states / 2
  seeds**, the §4.7 target exactly. Live engine test
  green — `s_after` 3.71 → 29.55 across a day-11 review, `momentum.recalled_7d` matching
  `reviews_7d` (the v1.0.7 fix holding), `retention` carrying its `grader_unvalidated`,
  `doctor ok=true`.

- **§5's read-only check needs an amendment, and it is not a v1.0.8 bug.** Hashing
  `~/.claude/learning` before and after every read path reports a mutation — traced to
  `report`, whose documented job is writing `artifacts/dashboard.html`. `report` is
  classified non-mutating in the dispatch table because it touches no *learning state*, so
  the protocol's own enumeration recipe hands it to a gate that then fails on it. Re-run with
  `report` excluded, every read path leaves the store byte-identical, and no state file is
  touched. **The gate should exempt `report` (or compare state files only)** — as written it
  cries wolf on every release, which is how a real read-path write would get waved through.

## 1.0.7 — 2026-07-19 · a flattering number, caught by the gate built for it

One engine fix, shipped hours after v1.0.6 because RELEASE_PROTOCOL §7.5 says a wrong
number does not get to stand. The independent post-release reviewer — standing
instruction: *"find a number that is wrong, especially one that is wrong in the
direction that reassures the learner"* — found exactly one, and it is bug class #1:

- **`momentum.recalled_7d` counted encode and pretest receipts as retrieval wins.** The
  docstring's contract is *"retrievals cleared, and genuine wins among them"* — wins ⊆
  retrievals — but the counter took ANY in-window receipt with `grade: "recalled"`.
  Encodes and pretests carry that grade in normal use, so a learner who encoded three
  concepts and never came back once read `recalled_7d: 3` beside `reviews_7d: 0` —
  three "genuine wins" with zero retrievals. One-line fix: the counter now shares the
  same genuine-retrieval predicate as `reviews_7d`.
- **And the embarrassing part, per protocol: the guarding selftest was theatre.** The
  v1.0.6 check asserting `recalled_7d == 1` could not fail — its encode fixtures were
  both out-of-window AND gradeless, so the inflating population never reached the
  counter under test. The fixture now carries an in-window `grade: "recalled"` encode
  AND pretest; the check fails by name when the fix is reverted (mutation-tested).
  That is the fourth §4.5 lesson in four releases: *a check that cannot see the
  inflating population proves nothing about inflation.*
- Blast radius, honestly: the prescribed `/coach` narration leads with
  `stability_gained_7d` / `reviews_7d` / `most_durable` (all correct) and never quotes
  `recalled_7d`; exposure was a narrator improvising off the JSON — which the docstring
  invited, by calling the field retrieval wins.
- Noted, unchanged: `retained_total`/`state_counts` label a node "retained" on FSRS
  graduation (before any retention test). That matches its docstring and the system-wide
  state convention, and the retention *metric* correctly excludes first exposures — a
  labeling convention to revisit, not a wrong number.
- Selftest count unchanged at **217/217** (an inert check was made real, none added).
  Re-fuzz after the fix: 0 crashes / 800 states.

## 1.0.6 — 2026-07-18 · Antigravity — the fifth platform

Engram now installs natively on **Google Antigravity** (`agy` CLI) — contributed by
@mertso13 in #8, two review rounds, every claim below verified live against agy 1.1.4
with a sandboxed `$HOME`.

- **One command:** `agy plugin install https://github.com/nagisanzenin/engram`. Root
  `plugin.json` is schema-minimal on purpose — the official
  `antigravity.google/schemas/v1/plugin.json` allows exactly `name` + `description`
  (`additionalProperties: false`); everything else is directory-crawled. The manifest is
  inert on the other four platforms (Claude Code reads `.claude-plugin/`, Codex
  `.codex-plugin/`, OpenCode npm/`.opencode/`, Hermes `skills.external_dirs`).
- **The bug that made it possible was ours, not theirs.** `agy plugin install` stats every
  file it copies — and died on `.opencode/skills/{learn,coach,review}/SKILL.md`, whose
  symlinks have been **self-referential loops since f3ccc76** (`../../` where three levels
  were needed: from `.opencode/skills/<n>/`, `../../skills/<n>/SKILL.md` resolves to
  *itself*). Nobody noticed for four releases because npm packs exclude symlinks and
  OpenCode's loader never stats them. Retargeted to `../../../`; git-clone OpenCode
  installs get real links out of it too.
- **Engine resolution gains the AG default** — the skills' chain is now
  `OPENCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT → CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT → CODEX_PLUGIN_ROOT → ENGRAM_ROOT →
  ~/.gemini/config/plugins/engram` (agy sets no plugin-root variable at all; the staging
  path is deterministic, so it rides last as the default).
- **And the embarrassing part, per protocol — this time the reviewer's.** The first
  review round's fix sketch *replaced* `$ENGRAM_ROOT` with the AG path while its prose
  said "before `$ENGRAM_ROOT`". The contributor implemented the sketch faithfully — which
  would have **broken Hermes**, the platform shipped one release ago, whose entire engine
  resolution runs through `ENGRAM_ROOT` (INSTALL-HERMES.md sets no plugin-root var). Caught
  in the second round by evaluating the installed chain side-by-side under
  `ENGRAM_ROOT=/fake/dev/clone`: new chain ignored it, old chain honored it. The lesson is
  §4.6's, inverted: *a reviewer's sketch is a diff too, and it gets the same scrutiny.*
- **Known limits, stated in the README footnote:** agy 1.1.4 **silently drops any agent
  whose frontmatter carries a `tools:` field** (any value — Claude names and snake_case
  both tested), so `engram-curriculum-architect` and `engram-artifact-smith` don't register
  on AG; only `engram-assessor` does. `agy plugin validate` still reports "3 agents
  processed" — *validate ≠ install ≠ register*. The due-review session nudge isn't ported
  (AG hooks use a different mechanism). Stripping `tools:` was rejected deliberately: it
  would grant those agents all tools on Claude Code, trading a real restriction for a
  cosmetic registration.
- **Engine: three shipped read-path bricks, found by this release's own fuzz gate** (§4.7:
  800 randomized garbage states × 24 read paths — the 24 include every read-only
  sub-action, per the amendment). All three predate this release; all three are the same
  lesson again:
  - `artifact list` crashed on an unhashable entry in `order` — because it hand-rolled the
    walk instead of using `graph_order`, the helper whose docstring *names this exact
    crash*. The checklist line "grep for the N+1th call site (`cmd_artifact` was the one
    missed)" was written about this command in v1.0.1. It was still the one missed.
  - `misconception list` crashed on a `None` entry (`it.get`) — reads now degrade past
    non-dict entries; mutators still refuse an unusable file outright (a lossy "repair"
    a mutator then saved would be data loss wearing a hard hat).
  - `report` crashed rendering an int-typed misconception field (`escape(123)`) — the
    dashboard, the one surface a human actually looks at, bricked by a hand-edited file.
    Fixed at the gate: `_open_misconceptions` now coerces narrator-facing fields to text.
  - Each fix carries a selftest check that asserts the *behavior* (the real entry survives
    the garbage beside it), and each check was mutation-tested: revert the fix, that
    specific check goes red. Selftest **214 → 217**. Re-fuzz after the fixes: **0 crashes**.

## 1.0.5 — 2026-07-18 · Hermes — the fourth platform, and the README stops being misread

Engram now runs on **Nous Research's Hermes Agent** (requested in #9), and the README
finally says out loud what too many people had to ask: this is a **learning system for
the human, not an agent-memory plugin**.

- **Hermes support, verified live** — not speculated. Every claim in
  [INSTALL-HERMES.md](INSTALL-HERMES.md) was exercised against a real Hermes v0.18.2
  install: external-dir discovery of all three skills (`_shared/` correctly ignored),
  `/review` and `/coach` slash registration, full SKILL.md injection on invocation
  (11.5 KB `/review`, 17.9 KB via a `/study` bundle), and the ambient nudge landing in
  the composed user message at the wire level (request dump inspected).
- **The install route is clone + `skills.external_dirs`, deliberately.** Hermes' hub
  installer copies only files referenced inside each skill folder, which would sever the
  skills from the shared `scripts/engram.py` engine. The doc says so and says why.
- **The `/learn` collision, handled honestly.** `/learn` is Hermes' own built-in
  (it authors new agent skills). Hermes detects the clash and skips auto-registering
  engram's `learn`, printing the escape hatch we document: `/skill learn` — or the
  optional one-line `/study` bundle. The new Hermes nudge rewrites its own
  "/learn to continue" line accordingly.
- **New `hooks/session-start-hermes.sh`** — a `pre_llm_call` port of the SessionStart
  re-anchor: same self-resolution, same degrade-to-silence contract, plus once-per-session
  dedupe keyed on Hermes' `session_id`. The engine is untouched (state still shared across
  every platform via `~/.claude/learning`).
- **README rework.** Leads with the disambiguation (agent memory vs. human learning —
  the most common misread), then a five-platform matrix: Claude Code (born here), Codex,
  OpenCode, Hermes, Antigravity (in review, #8). New first FAQ entry for the same
  confusion. `INSTALL-CODEX.md` omni-repo line updated.
- **Known limits, stated in the doc:** headless `hermes chat -q` does not expand
  slash-skills (interactive CLI/TUI/gateway only); the delegate_task assessor flow and
  gateway/cron delivery are recipe-documented but not yet driven end-to-end with a
  capable model. Engine selftest unchanged at 214/214; no engine code changed
  (`ENGRAM_VERSION` pin only).
- **And the embarrassing part, per protocol.** The pre-release review (28 agents,
  10 confirmed findings) caught the brand-new hook **failing open two independent
  ways** — an empty `session_id` bypassed the once-per-session guard entirely, and a
  misplaced `2>/dev/null` meant an unwritable TMPDIR both leaked bash errors to stderr
  and re-nudged on *every* LLM call. The hook whose one-line contract is "ambient,
  never nagging" shipped to review as a per-call nagger under exactly two failure
  modes its author had tested around. Both fixed (dedupe now fails *closed* to a
  per-process key; unwritable marker → silence), plus a 9-case failure battery
  including both reviewer repros. The same review caught the install doc omitting the
  `ENGRAM_ROOT` export the skills' engine resolution depends on, the cron recipe
  delivering the un-rewritten `/learn` it warns about two sections earlier (the hook
  is now dual-mode: JSON for `pre_llm_call`, plain rewritten text on empty stdin for
  cron), a missed `package-lock.json` bump, and five README cross-consistency slips
  (the nudge exists on OpenCode too; "five platforms" counted one still in review;
  the Codex install cell was missing its second command; the OpenCode global-path and
  pin-to-source details had been dropped; the `/learn` onboarding example sat unscoped
  under a matrix that includes Hermes).

## 1.0.4 — 2026-07-17 · updates that only speak when something changed

The OpenCode update flow gets honest and inspectable, and its last shell command is gone.

- **Content-aware diff.** `diffCategory` now compares files byte-for-byte
  (`Buffer.equals`) instead of by existence. Identical files are silently ignored, new
  files ride the `copyMissing` extract, and only genuinely modified files reach the
  `skipped` list — so a metadata-only version bump produces no manifest, no
  pseudo-command, no notification. Unreadable files fail safe into `skipped`.
- **Unified diff viewer.** A version bump with real changes now also writes
  `.engram-update.diff` (standard `---/+++/@@` format), and `/engram-update` grows a
  "View changes" option — the model reads the diff and summarizes what changed before
  the user decides. Cleaned up alongside the manifest in every resolution mode.
- **Zero Bash in the update template.** A new `cleanup` mode on the `engram_update`
  tool replaces the template's last `rm -f`, and an `isWithinTarget` path-traversal
  guard validates every resolved path in `auto` and `per_file` modes — defense in
  depth against tampered manifests. Uses `path.sep`, so the guard holds on Windows.
- **Verification.** Vitest 51 → 88 (new `diffLines` suite incl. an insertion
  trailing-context regression test, tampered-manifest traversal tests, cleanup-mode
  tests). Engine selftest unchanged at 214/214.

Contributed by @luanweslley77 (#6), one review round.

## 1.0.3 — 2026-07-16 · OpenCode — the third platform

Engram now runs on **OpenCode**, alongside Claude Code and Codex. Same skills, same
`engram.py` engine, same receipts — the port is a thin TypeScript adapter that satisfies
OpenCode's plugin contract and shells out to the unchanged Python core.

- **Self-extract bridge.** OpenCode loads plugins from its npm cache, which is not a
  config directory, so native discovery never sees the plugin's skills/agents. On first
  run the `config` hook extracts `skills/ agents/ scripts/` into the OpenCode config dir
  (`~/.config/opencode/` or the project's `.opencode/`) behind a `copyMissing` guard that
  never overwrites a user's edits; a first-session `cfg.*` bridge registers everything
  immediately, and disk discovery takes over thereafter.
- **Deterministic update tool.** `/engram-update` appears on a version bump and applies
  refreshes through the `engram_update` custom tool — deletes go through `unlinkSync` with
  every path validated against the manifest allowlist. No bash, no interpolation.
- **Hooks.** `shell.env` exports `OPENCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT`; `experimental.chat.system.transform`
  carries the review-due nudge; a `session.idle` toast announces available updates.
- **Verification.** New vitest suite (67 tests) covering extract, the manifest state machine,
  and the update tool's path validation; `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs vitest +
  `tsc --noEmit` + `engram.py selftest` on every push. Engine selftest unchanged at 214/214.

## 1.0.2 — 2026-07-11 · a regression my own fix caused

The v1.0.1 verification review confirmed both headline fixes hold (the export leak is closed; the
power floor is unbuyable) — and found that **v1.0.1's finding-#4 fix introduced a new crash.**

Switching `compute_modality` to the shared `_outcome` predicate was correct — but `_outcome`
returns `None` on a hand-edited un-scoreable receipt, and `0.0 += None` is a `TypeError` that
bricked `stats`, and therefore `/coach`. **The same release fixed this exact bug class in `settle`
(finding #5) and did not carry the guard one function over.** The test gap mirrored the code gap:
there was a settle-degradation check and no modality one, so 213/213 stayed green over a live brick.

- **Fixed:** modality drops the un-scoreable datum, like every other read path. Reads degrade, they
  never brick.
- **The fuzz fixture now includes an un-scoreable FIRST review**, so this class cannot hide again —
  the gate missed it because no fixture gave a node a `None`-outcome first review, which is the only
  shape that reaches modality's per-node first-review logic.

Selftest **213 → 214.**

## 1.0.1 — 2026-07-11 · TWO post-release reviews, and the leak the whole project exists to prevent

Two independent reviewers read shipped code — v1.0.0 (the Commons) and the still-in-`main` v0.9.0
(the Method). Between them, **one critical leak and one severe measurement bug**, plus five more.
Selftest **207 → 213.**

### ⚠⚠ CRITICAL — `export` leaked free text verbatim. The v1.0 headline was false.

`arm` and `stratum` were **strings on the whitelist** — and a whitelist that admits a free-text
field is a hole in the whitelist. `stratify_by: ["claim"]` routed **every node's `claim` text,
verbatim**, into the export's `stratum` field — while the file's own `stripped` list swore `claim`
was removed. The learner-authored `arm` label leaked on **every** experiment. A hand-forged
`grader` string left uncapped.

```
LEAKED into the "attributed, text-stripped" export:
  CLAIM-CANARY: 4   ARCHITECT-SECRET-CANARY: 4   ARM-CANARY-LEAK: 1   stigmatized: 4
```

**Fixed:** `arm`, `stratum`, and `grader` now leave as **hashes** (`arm_hash`, `stratum_hash`,
`grader_hash`). The only strings that leave un-hashed are `kind`/`grade`/`rating` — **closed
enums the engine validates**, not text a human wrote. *A whitelist that admits a free-text field
strips nothing.*

**And the reviewer named exactly why the gate missed it:** the leak-test **never started an
experiment**, so `arm`/`stratum` were always `None` in the fixture. **It asserted the whitelist
keys were clean by never populating them.** The test now stuffs the canary into *every* authored
surface — the experiment arm, a stratum pointed at a node's `claim`, an arbitrary architect
field — which is the exact path the reviewer used.

### ⚠ SEVERE — the power floor could be bought down with one payload field

`experiment settle` gated `powered` on the *design's own* `min_per_arm`. A trial declaring
`min_per_arm: 6` — the underpowered v0.8 default this release exists to **kill** — certified as
`powered: true` and read *"suggestive"* on six data points per arm. **And the shipped skill
promised the opposite:** *"the settle will read underpowered, and it will be right."* It did not.

**Fixed:** `powered` gates on `max(design, EXPERIMENT_MIN_PER_ARM)`. A design may set a *higher*
bar; it can never buy the engine's floor down. *A power gate you can lower with a payload field is
not a power gate.*

### And five more, all in shipped code

- **Optional stopping.** `settle` had no status guard — re-settling as data arrived kept only the
  last verdict and **roughly tripled the false-positive rate (0.04 → 0.117)**. Peek-and-re-settle
  until the coin lands is the exact fallacy pre-registration forbids. Now: **an experiment is
  analysed once.** `start` already refused a second active experiment; `settle` now refuses a
  second analysis of the same one.
- **A broken bootstrap CI.** It percentile-bootstrapped `max(mean) − min(mean)`, a non-negative
  extreme-order statistic — so for 3+ arms the *"95% CI" excluded its own point estimate* (three
  identical arms, spread 0.000, CI [0.033, 0.367]). It manufactured a strategy separation that was
  not there. Now: a **signed two-arm difference** CI (which has no such floor), and **None for
  k > 2** with the read saying so. *Refusing to draw a bad CI is more honest than drawing one.*
- **`first_review_recall` meant two different numbers.** `stats.modality` scored a `partial` as a
  full **1.0**; the experiment engine, on the identically-named metric, scored it **0.5**. Same
  name, same engine, same data, two answers — and modality's was the lenient one. Both now use
  `_outcome`, the shared predicate. (§4.8 Q1: the engine's commands must agree.)
- **`settle` bricked** (not degraded) on a hand-edited receipt whose `rating` was a truthy
  non-rating with no grade — `sum([1.0, None])` → `TypeError`, and `status` had greenlit the settle
  first. Now it drops the un-scoreable data point, like every other read path.
- **The no-network guarantee, made honest about its limit.** The AST scan is a strong regression
  guard, not an impossibility proof (`__import__`, `importlib`, `ctypes`, `exec` would pass it). So
  the engine also contains **none of those dynamic-import primitives**, checked by a new selftest —
  the two checks together support "no network code AND no way to smuggle one in dynamically," which
  a single import-scan cannot claim alone.
- `grader_qwk` on each receipt now ships with a `qwk_note` stating plainly that it is the grader's
  validity **at export time**, stamped on every receipt regardless of when it was graded — the best
  available estimate, not a per-receipt measurement.

**Everything the two reviewers checked and found clean is on the record:** the randomization-test
p-value (valid under unequal n, false-positive rate at/below nominal), block randomization (stable,
balanced, reproducible), the modality floor move, and **every v0.8.1 fix still holds after the
merge.**

## 1.0.0 — 2026-07-11 · THE COMMONS — the first learning system that is also an experiment the whole field can read

The evidence base of learning science is built on **undergraduates, word pairs, and 20-minute
retention intervals.** Almost nothing tests *self-directed adults*, on *hard conceptual material*,
at *30–90 day horizons*, with *blind-graded free recall*.

That is not a gap anyone chose. It is a gap because, until roughly 2026, **grading free recall at
scale was impossible.** You needed a human to read every answer.

Engram produces exactly that data as a byproduct of being useful — and, since v0.7, with a
**measured** oracle behind every grade. The open question is sitting right there: an AI tutor built
on this exact dialogue grammar produced **~2× the learning gains of an active-learning classroom**
([Kestin et al., Harvard, *Scientific Reports*, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97652-6))
— measured on an **immediate post-test.** **Nobody has ever measured whether AI-tutoring gains
survive to thirty days.**

Selftest **201 → 207**.

### `export` — a file, not a request

```bash
python3 scripts/engram.py export --contributor "@you"
```

| leaves | never leaves |
|---|---|
| grades, ratings, confidence | **your productions** — every word you wrote |
| timings, stability, intervals, retrievability | **probes, claims, rubrics** |
| `kind`, `artifact`, `arm`, `stratum` | **goals, interests, misconception text** |
| `grader` and its **measured QWK** | **topic names and node ids** — hashed, not carried |

- **The payload is a WHITELIST.** Every field is constructed by name. **There is no code path by
  which a production could arrive** — not *"we remembered to delete it."* A blacklist is a promise
  you must keep every release; a whitelist is one you keep by construction. (Same lesson `gold`
  taught in v0.7, and the reason both are built the same way.) A **property-based selftest** puts a
  canary string in *every* field the schema has — **and some it doesn't** — and asserts not one
  character survives.
- **The `stripped` list ships INSIDE the file**, so the promise is verifiable by the person making
  it rather than merely asserted at them.
- **The hash caveat, stated out loud:** a hash of a *common* topic name (`transformers`) is
  recoverable by dictionary attack in seconds. It hides the topic from a casual reader, **not from
  someone who wants it** — and the export is attributed anyway. `export --topic T` exists so you can
  choose. *An honest caveat beats a fake guarantee.*

### v0.7 GATES v1.0 — and it is a refusal, not a warning

`export` **refuses** if your assessor has not passed its audit:

```
REFUSING TO EXPORT: the grader behind every one of these grades is unaudited.
A finding aggregated from unaudited oracles is not a finding — it is noise with a schema,
and publishing it would put a number into the world that nobody can stand behind.
```

Every shared receipt carries its grader's **measured QWK**, and the bundle carries the gold set's
own **circularity limit** (`gold_adjudication: "authored"`). A number you cannot stand behind should
not enter the world with your name on it.

### THE ENGINE HAS NO NETWORK CODE — and that is now structural, permanent, and mutation-tested

Not *"no network by default."* **None.**

```
⚠ THE ENGINE HAS NO NETWORK CODE — structural, permanent, and never to be deleted
⚠ …and it never SHELLS OUT (no subprocess, no os.system/popen/exec/spawn)
```

- The check **parses the engine's own AST** — it does not grep. **The first draft grepped its own
  source for the word `curl` and found it, in its own comment and inside its own regex literal. It
  failed on itself.** The AST cannot see a comment or a string; it reports only what the interpreter
  will actually execute. *If a structural guarantee can be defeated by a comment, it was never
  structural.*
- And it is **mutation-tested by INTRODUCING the thing** — four mutations add a real `import
  socket`, a real `import urllib.request`, a real `import subprocess`, and a real
  `os.system("curl …")`, and all four go red. **For an absence check, nulling the detector proves
  nothing** — it just makes the check vacuously true, which is exactly what it already is on a clean
  codebase. (Now written into the protocol.)

`export` writes a file and stops. The **agent** posts — via `gh`, which is already installed,
already authenticated, and already trusted with the whole machine. That is not a loophole; **it is
the correct place to put the boundary**, because the thing the *100% local* badge is about is
`engram.py`, and `engram.py` will never grow a socket.

### It is ATTRIBUTED, and we are not going to lie to you about it

`gh` posts from your account. A **"salted anonymous hash"** riding inside a signed envelope would be
theatre the moment the envelope is signed. **You cannot have one-keystroke upload *and* anonymity.
Pick one, and say which out loud.**

**Attribution is also the stronger science.** A retention study lives on **longitudinal linkage** —
following *the same learner across months* **is** the question. Attributed, linkable series at n=100
are worth more than anonymous one-shot dumps at n=500. It also buys dedup, fabrication detection,
the ability to ask a follow-up, and the ability to **credit you** — the only honest incentive on
offer.

This is not telemetry. **It is a consenting, named, informed participant in an open study**, which is
what every good study has always had.

### `/coach contribute` — and degrading to silence is what makes the consent real

Shows you the file. Names the exact handle it will post under, **before** it asks. Posts only on an
explicit yes.

**No `gh`, not authenticated, offline, any failure at all → print the path, one line, stop.** No
error. No retry. **No nag.** The file is still yours.

> **`gh` is a convenience, never a dependency — and declining must cost the learner nothing, or the
> consent is not real.** A person who feels a cost in saying no has not consented. They have complied.

### Also

- **[CONTRIBUTING-DATA.md](CONTRIBUTING-DATA.md)** — a real informed-consent document, not a privacy
  policy. What leaves, what never does, that it is **public and attributed**, and how to withdraw
  (**it is a GitHub post — delete it**; that is the entire mechanism, deliberately).
- `ENGRAM_VERSION` — the engine finally knows its own version, pinned against the plugin manifest by
  a selftest so it cannot drift. A corpus of receipts from unknown engine versions is not a corpus.
- `exports/` created on `init`. Exports are append-only, like receipts and audits.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-07-11 · THE METHOD — the experiment machinery was not sound enough to support the claims it exists to make

Article 7 (*"adapt on evidence, never taxonomy"*) is the article that replaces learning styles with
real n-of-1 measurement. **Four defects, all in shipped code, and the last one is the worst thing in
this repository's history:**

| # | the defect | what it means |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `arm = arms[len(assignments) % len(arms)]` | **ROUND-ROBIN, not randomized.** Perfectly predictable. |
| 2 | unstratified | Explorables are routed to the hardest concepts **on purpose**, so the comparison carried the **material** as well as the medium. `docs/06` open-Q2 disclosed that confound *honestly* — and never fixed it. |
| 3 | `min_per_arm: 6` | The SCED alternating-treatments literature puts sufficient power at ~28–30 observations. Six per arm is **underpowered by ~2.5×** (`docs/07` §9). |
| 4 | **`exp["verdict"] = args.verdict`** | **THE MODEL COMPUTED THE VERDICT.** A payload said *"derivation-first won"* and the engine wrote it down. A direct violation of **invariant #2 — the engine owns every number** — in the one command whose entire purpose is a number nobody is allowed to make up. |

**A confounded, unpowered, round-robin trial settled by narration is not evidence. It is a vibe
with a JSON file.**

Selftest **191 → 201** (this release merges the v0.8.1 fixes).

### What it is now

- **Randomized, and reproducible.** Balanced **block randomization** keyed on `(seed, stratum)`:
  within each block the order is random, and every arm appears exactly once. Not `random.choice`
  (which randomizes and never balances — a 20-node run could land 14/6 and the effect would be
  measured over an arm that barely exists). Not round-robin (which balances and never randomizes —
  which is what shipped). **The seed is recorded, so every assignment is recomputable by anyone who
  holds it.** An assignment nobody can reproduce is not an assignment; it is an anecdote.
- **Stratified — and this is the part that kills the confound.** Randomize the medium *within* one
  affordance class and the material stops riding along with it. `docs/06`'s open question 2 is
  finally *answerable* instead of merely disclosed.
- **Pre-registered.** The design file **is** the pre-registration: question, arms, metric, seed,
  strata, power, analysis — written before a single datum exists. An **unknown metric dies**: the
  engine will not guess which number you meant and then report it as fact.
- **Powered.** `min_per_arm` defaults to **15** (~30 observations). You may set it lower — the engine
  records a `power_note` saying you chose to, and the settle reads `underpowered`, and it is right.
- **THE ENGINE COMPUTES THE VERDICT.** `settle --verdict` is now **refused, loudly.** The engine
  returns per-arm n and means, the effect, an **exact randomization test** p-value (shuffle the arm
  labels — valid *by construction*, because the engine randomized them itself), a bootstrap 95% CI,
  and the per-stratum balance. The model narrates it. It does not make it up.
- **`experiment status`** — progress against the power floor, so nobody settles early by accident.
- **p is never 0.** Add-one correction: with 10,000 permutations the floor is 1/10,001. A p-value of
  exactly zero is a claim no finite test can make, and this engine does not make claims it cannot.

### `stats.modality`'s floor moved with it — and that SUPPRESSES a number some learners can see today

`MODALITY_MIN_N` was **6**, inherited from the same underpowered convention, and `docs/10` predicted
this exactly: *"stats.modality's identical ≥6 floor inherits the same defect and moves with it."* It
is now **15**.

**This means some existing learners will lose a number their dashboard used to show.** That is
correct. **The number was never earned.** Suppressing an unearned number is not a regression — it is
the product.

### The §4.7 rule that found the bug had a hole, and the hole was the same shape

The protocol says: *enumerate the read paths from the **dispatch table**, not from memory.* But
`experiment` lives in `mutating` (start/assign/settle write) — so its **read sub-actions**
(`status`, `list`) were **invisible to the enumeration** and had never been fuzzed. The first time
they were: **72 crashes in 600 states.** `arms` as an int, `arms` absent, `arms` holding a dict
(unhashable, and it poisoned the dict it was used as a key in).

**A command with sub-actions has a read path PER SUB-ACTION.** Fixed at one gate (`_exp_arms`), and
the rule is amended.

### `as_number` let infinity through — the numeric gate for the entire engine

`Infinity` and `NaN` are **not valid JSON** — and Python's `json` module parses them anyway. An
`inf` sailed through every `isinstance(x, float)` check and then died on the first `int()`
(`OverflowError`), and a `NaN` **compares False to everything, including itself**, so it poisons
every comparison it touches without raising anything at all.

Three crashes in `decay` and `experiment status`, in code with no other flaw. **Fixed at the gate**
— `as_number` is the funnel for every scheduler leaf, every metric, every threshold in the engine.
One line here; forty at the call sites, and the forty-first is the one that ships.

Fuzz: **0 crashes / 13,500 invocations across 18 read paths.**

## 0.8.1 — 2026-07-11 · THE RULER WAS NEVER TESTED, ONLY THE SUBJECT

The post-release review (§7.5) found **11 defects in shipped v0.8.0**, and the two worst are the
same failure the release was written to end.

Selftest **180 → 191**.

### ⚠ #1 — The capstone's transfer receipt was DEAD DATA

The learner builds the capstone, passes it, and `stats.transfer` reads
**"NO CAPABILITY HAS EVER BEEN MEASURED"** — while the receipt sits on disk. Two independent causes:

- The capstone is built **once**, so its transfer receipt is its **first** receipt — and the v0.6.1
  rule (*"a node's first receipt is its encoding event"*) swallowed it. But **a capstone has no
  encoding phase at all.** The build *is* the event.
- The census skipped it anyway: it is minted with `transfer_probe: None` (*"the capstone IS the
  transfer probe"*), and the census required a non-empty one.

**A FAILED capstone was discarded entirely** — the single most diagnostic event in the whole system
(*"I could not actually use this topic"*), silently dropped.

This is v0.8's own thesis — *"`transfer_probe` was authored since v0.1 and read by NOTHING"* —
**reproduced one level up, on the most important node in the graph.** Receipts now carry a
`capstone` stamp (written at grading time, like the `artifact` medium stamp), and the census asks
`has_transfer_question()`, which the capstone answers yes to.

### ⚠ #2 — The headline ranked a learner who LOST every capability ABOVE one who MASTERED every one

`node.transfer.state` was deliberately **latest-evidence**, with a docstring saying *"a capability
that fired in June and failed in September is not currently owned, and pretending otherwise would
be a wrong number in the flattering direction."*

They fixed it in `state` and shipped it in `rate_fired` — which pooled the **entire lifetime log**
and was **order-blind**. It is the number `/coach` leads with and the dashboard's first chip:

| learner | history | **owns now** | **v0.8.0 headline** |
|---|---|---|---|
| IMPROVING | failed all 5 twice, then **mastered all 5** | `applied: 5` | **"FIRED on 33%"** |
| DECLINING | passed all 5 twice, then **lost all 5** | `applied: 0` | **"FIRED on 67%"** |

**The learner with zero current capability scored exactly double the one who owned all five** — and
the dashboard rendered `fired 67%` and `owned 0` as **adjacent chips.** That is not a lenient
ruler. It is a **negative** one, and every number downstream had its sign flipped.

**Two numbers, two names:** `owned_rate` (**THE HEADLINE** — of the capabilities you have probed,
how many do you own *right now*; order-aware, exactly as `state` is) and `probe_fire_rate` (the
lifetime probe-level **history**, order-blind by construction, named as history so it can never be
mistaken for the headline again).

> **And the part that matters most.** The shipped §5.5 instrument gate missed this because it
> varied the **bar** (recalled / partial / lapsed, on one node, with one receipt) and **never varied
> the population.** *It tested the subject, not the ruler* — the exact lesson v0.7 was written to
> teach, repeated one release later, in the gate written to teach it.

### ⚠ #4 — A failed transfer probe destroyed 97% of the memory's durability

v0.8 separated the three populations **in the metrics** and pooled them **in the scheduler.** On a
mature node — the only kind the system ever probes — one failed probe did this:

```
s: 443.5 → 12.3      (97% of the memory's durability, deleted)
state: review → learning     lapses: 0 → 1     due: 2027-03-01 → 2026-03-17
```

…and dropped the node below the transfer bar, so it could never be re-probed. **Answering a HARDER
question wrong demolished the schedule for the ORIGINAL concept.** It contradicted three separate
sentences the same release shipped, including `_transfer_ready`'s own docstring warning about
*"a lapse the schedule then punishes — a fabricated setback."* The maturity gate was built to
prevent exactly that, and only ever guarded *immature* nodes.

**A transfer lapse now leaves `fsrs` completely untouched** — and the receipt records
`s_before == s_after` plus a `schedule_unchanged` note, so the evidence is honest about the fact
that nothing moved. A transfer **success** still strengthens the memory, because applying an idea
*is* a retrieval, and a strong one.

### And seven more, all in shipped code

3. **`add-topic --replace` destroyed a completed capstone's schedule.** The payload never contains a
   capstone, so `_has_capstone` was always false on a replace and it was always re-minted `state:
   new` — after the carry-forward loop, making it the one surviving node never carried forward. And
   it **flattered**: the reset removed the rotting capstone from `retention.unmeasured`, so *"1
   concept past due and unretrieved"* became *"30-day recall 100%"*. **Survivorship bias, through a
   new door.**
5. **`--replace` wiped `node.transfer` and never rebuilt it** (unlike `artifact`, which is recomputed
   from evidence). Graph said `None`; `stats` still said `applied: 1`. Two sources, two truths.
6. **No maturity gate at INGEST** — only at *selection*. A bare CLI `rate --kind transfer` certified
   `applied` on a node encoded **yesterday**, while `transfer` itself returned zero candidates: the
   engine refused to probe the very node it had just certified. (§4.8 Q5: the skills pass what the
   engine expects; the CLI is the door nobody guards.)
7. **`calibration_encode` was a RESIDUAL bucket** (`not in review_ids`), so transfer receipts fell
   straight into a bucket whose own docstring calls it *"first-exposure (encode) guesses."* Transfer
   is precisely where a learner is **most** overconfident — they know the concept, the capability
   doesn't fire — so that overconfidence was misattributed to their encoding self-assessment, and
   `/coach` would diagnose the wrong faculty and prescribe the wrong fix. **A residual bucket
   silently absorbs every kind you add later.** Now named: `calibration_transfer`.
8. **A payload node named `capstone` was silently destroyed** — and the minted capstone then listed
   **itself** in `requires`, so it could never be served, while `next` cheerfully reported *"this
   topic is finished."* Now refused, like `cmd_capstone` already did.
9. **`stats.transfer` had no minimum-n floor.** Every sibling has one (calibration 10, modality 15,
   the grader audit 30). One probe read **"FIRED on 100%"** and chipped it on the dashboard while
   `calibration` correctly said `insufficient-data` on the same state. Floor: **5**. Counts are facts
   and are always shown; a rate a single datum can swing by 20 points is not a rate.
10. **`reps >= 3` counted the ENCODE**, so an advertised *"3+ retrievals"* delivered **2**. Maturity
    now counts retrievals from the receipt log — the engine's own doctrine is that the first receipt
    is the encoding event, *not* a retrieval.
11. **An UNDATED receipt became the LATEST transfer evidence.** `_sort_key` deliberately sorts a
    garbage-`ts` receipt **last** (so it can never win day-0) — and taking `ts[-1]` therefore handed
    it the crown. A hand-edited undated `recalled` flipped a node to `applied` over a real, dated
    `lapsed`. **The v0.6 fix and the v0.8 rule collided, and they collided in the flattering
    direction.**

### Also

- **`as_number` let `Infinity` and `NaN` through** — not valid JSON, and Python's `json` module
  parses them anyway. An `inf` sailed through every `isinstance(x, float)` check and died on the
  first `int()`; a `NaN` compares False to everything, including itself, and never raises at all.
  Fixed at **the** numeric gate for the entire engine. Fuzz: **0 crashes / 12,750 invocations.**

## 0.8.0 — 2026-07-11 · THE CLAIM — Engram measured memory and claimed capability. Now it measures both.

`transfer_probe` has been authored by the curriculum architect **since v0.1**, stored by the
engine, and **read by nothing.** On the founder's own graph, **12 of 13 nodes carry one**, and
`grep transfer_probe scripts/engram.py` found exactly one line: a `setdefault`. **Zero transfer
receipts existed anywhere, ever.**

`skills/learn` §5 said of the capstone: *"this is the point of the whole topic — do not let it
silently not happen."* It silently did not happen, every single time, because it was **a line of
prose in a skill file** — and a tutor running low on context drops a suggestion. It does not drop
a DAG.

Engram has been a very good memory system wearing a capability system's marketing.

Selftest **167 → 180**.

### The three populations — because there are now genuinely three questions

v0.6.4's bug was **four implementations of one rule**, three of them wrong, and the fix was one
shared predicate. The temptation now is to bolt transfer onto that predicate — which is the same
bug from the other end: **one definition covering three questions, and therefore answering none.**

| population | the question it answers | who reads it |
|---|---|---|
| `_review_receipts` | *does the memory survive N days?* | **retention (the north star)**, recall_by_stability, calibration, modality, adherence |
| `_transfer_receipts` | *does the capability fire in new clothes?* | `stats.transfer`, `node.transfer` |
| `_retrieval_receipts` | *how much durability was actually grown?* | momentum |

**Never pooled.** Retention pooled with transfer would drag the north star down with a harder
question and answer neither. Momentum *without* transfer would understate real growth — a transfer
probe advances the FSRS schedule like any other rating, and **undercounting a learner's real
progress is its own dishonesty**, in the direction that quietly tells them their work did not land.

### Engine

- **`transfer [--topic T]`** — the mature concepts ready for the harder question. Eligible = stability
  over **21 days** across **3+ retrievals**, a non-null `transfer_probe`, and not probed in the last
  **30 days** (it is a tool, not a quiz show). Untested first, then coldest.
- **`node.transfer`** — `untested → probed → applied`. Engine-owned, written only by a transfer
  receipt, derived from the append-only log. **Computed from the LATEST evidence, not from "ever":**
  a capability that fired in June and failed in September is not currently owned, and pretending
  otherwise would be a wrong number in the flattering direction.
- **`stats.transfer`** — reported beside retention and never inside it.
- **`capstone --topic T`** — materialize the build as a **real node in the DAG** (idempotent: twice →
  one node). New topics get one from `add-topic` automatically. It `requires` **every** other
  concept, so it unlocks exactly when the frontier empties and then arrives in `next` like anything
  else. **It cannot silently not happen, because it is in the graph.**
- **The capstone gets NO provisional credit.** An ordinary node advances on a stashed-but-ungraded
  prerequisite (so the tutor can keep teaching while the assessor works). The capstone does not — it
  is the claim that the learner can now *use* the topic, and serving it on mastery the assessor has
  not confirmed is exactly the unearned claim the constitution forbids. *Found by an existing check
  breaking the moment the capstone entered the DAG.*
- A payload can no longer **claim** a transfer state or mint its own capstone (invariant #4: state
  advances only through receipts).
- `due` now carries `transfer_ready` + `transfer_probe`, so `/review` serves the harder question
  without a second engine call.

### §4.8 Q1 caught a two-bar bug before the gate even ran

The first cut reported a single `rate` counting anything not-`lapsed` — so a node whose only
transfer receipt was `partial` read **`rate: 1.0`** while its own state read **`probed`**, because
`state: applied` requires `recalled`. **Two numbers, one state, two silently different definitions
of success — and the looser one was the flattering one.**

Now **`rate_fired`** (recalled only — the bar `state: applied` uses) is the headline, because *"is
this capability mine?"* is a yes/no question and a half-application is not a yes. **`rate_any`**
(recalled-or-partial) ships beside it, because that is the **same bar retention uses** and the two
numbers are only comparable if they are measured the same way. **There is no bare `rate` key.**

### The new protocol gates, applied to the release that wrote them

- **§5.5 THE INSTRUMENT GATE** — earned in v0.7.1, where a gold set built to catch a lenient grader
  turned out to be *rewarding* leniency. `stats.transfer` **certifies** ("this capability is yours"),
  so a deliberately WRONG subject must score WORSE: a learner who fails every transfer probe now
  provably reads below one whose capability fires. *A ruler that ranks failure above success is not
  a lenient ruler; it is a negative one, and every number downstream has its sign flipped.*
- **§4.8 Q4 — open the dashboard.** `stats.transfer` renders on the HTML page, and **"NO CAPABILITY
  HAS EVER BEEN MEASURED"** appears there **in red** — not only in the JSON that just a test ever
  opens. That is the rule v0.7 shipped a bug to learn.
- **§4.7 — enumerate the read paths from the dispatch table, not from memory.** It caught `transfer`
  missing from the fuzzer immediately. Fuzz: **0 crashes / 9,600 invocations, 16 read paths.**

## 0.7.1 — 2026-07-11 · THE GOLD SET FAILED BEFORE THE GRADER DID

Shipped within the hour of v0.7.0, because the post-release review (§7.5) found that **the
instrument built to catch a lenient grader was itself rewarding leniency.** Everything below was
found in *shipped* code, by a reviewer who was not the author.

### The finding, and it is more important than any number here

The reviewer ran the one test nobody had thought to run: it graded the gold set with a **correct**
grader and with a deliberately **fooled** one.

| grader | QWK |
|---|---|
| says `lapsed` on `g_009` (**correct** — 0 of 3 rubric criteria met) | 0.990 |
| says `partial` on `g_009` (**fooled** by a fluent-but-empty production) | **1.000** |

**The fooled grader scored higher. The gold set was ranking leniency above correctness.** The
instrument was inverted.

The cause: **five lenient adjudications by the gold set's own author**, every one the same
species — *crediting an adjacent fact as partial credit.* Majority is not intersection
(`g_034`). Consonance is not pitch-set arithmetic (`g_038`). The history of a theory is not its
mechanism (`g_009`). *"It's ambiguous, break the tie"* is not *"the vectors assert concurrency"*
(`g_039`). *"You don't need inference any more"* is not *"the likelihood dominates"* (`g_032`).

**The grader had caught all five, three runs out of three** — including on a `fluent-but-empty`
item, which means **the author was fooled by fluency in the very category built to catch being
fooled by fluency.**

### What that does to the number

Correcting them moves agreement **0.889 → 0.965** and QWK **0.93 → 0.978**.

> **That rise is not evidence the grader got better. It is evidence that the instrument had been
> measuring the AUTHOR'S inconsistency, not the grader's validity.**

And the corrections were *prompted by the grader's own disagreements* — so the QWK that follows is
**circular**. An authored gold set cannot validate a grader from the same model family: when the
two disagree and the author concedes, the agreement that follows measures only the author's
willingness to concede.

- **The engine now says this on every audit** (`gold_adjudication: "authored"`, and the caveat
  rides in the `read` string), until someone who is not the author adjudicates the set.
- **The QWK badge is gone.** Replaced by **`grader never inflates · 0/198`** — the one claim that
  survives, and that the correction made *stronger*: every authoring error was LENIENT, so fixing
  them moved the bar **down**, giving the grader more room to be caught inflating. Across 198 blind
  judgments it still graded UP exactly zero times. That is a **safety property**, and it does not
  depend on the gold being perfectly calibrated.
- **One genuine disagreement (`g_054`) is deliberately KEPT.** The reviewer read both readings and
  judged the gold's defensible. Correcting an item to match the grader *when an independent party
  says the gold was right* is exactly the fitting that turns a measurement into a mirror.
  **An instrument with no disagreement left in it measures nothing.**
- Every corrected item carries a `disputed` record with its original grade, so the correction is
  **auditable rather than laundered**.
- `by_case_type["fluent-but-empty"]` — the canary v0.7.0 told v0.8 to watch for harshness drift —
  was reading **90% / −0.10** when the truth was **100% / +0.00**. A maintainer could have "fixed"
  a harshness that did not exist by loosening the grader on precisely the case the separation of
  powers exists to protect.

### And three more, all in shipped code

1. **A `pass` threw away its own caveats — and `pass` is the ONE verdict where the teeth are off.**
   The pass branch built a fresh `read` and never joined `reasons`; `grader-health` never returned
   the key at all, though `skills/coach` is told to *"read `reasons` aloud."* So three copy-pasted
   runs produced `identical_runs: true`, the engine wrote *"test-retest measures nothing here"* to
   disk — and then printed **"test-retest 1.00"** as a validated figure. The most reassuring number
   in the payload, quoted as evidence, by the branch that had just discarded the note explaining it
   was evidence of nothing. **Bug class #4 — a guard nobody reads — reproduced inside the release
   built to catch it.** And the selftest was complicit: it asserted `reasons` *contained* the
   caveat, which proves nothing about whether any surface ever reads it. **A field is not a
   narrator.**
2. **`grader_unvalidated` was believed from the file instead of derived from the verdict.** An
   audit carrying `"verdict": "fail"` with `"grader_unvalidated": false` silenced the teeth
   completely — no stamp, no red on the dashboard, retention reading a clean *"30-day recall 100%"* —
   in the one function whose docstring swears it *"fails toward 'we don't know', never toward
   'it's fine'."* It is now a **function of the verdict**, not an input.
3. **`cmd_artifact set|clear` was the last mutator reading a raw node value** — `TypeError` on a
   corrupt node. Worse than an ordinary crash: **`doctor` recommends `artifact clear` as the fix
   for a corrupt artifact field**, so the repair the tool told you to run was the thing that blew up.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-07-11 · THE ORACLE — the grader that writes every receipt has now itself been graded

The blind assessor's verdict drives mastery, retention, calibration, and the schedule. Its
agreement with any ground truth had **never been measured**. The constitution says *"the oracle
is never a vibe"*; it had been one — an excellent one, unaudited — and the hole sat directly
under the foundation, because **if the grader is lenient, every number Engram has ever printed
is inflated and nothing in the system could discover it.**

Selftest **129 → 152**.

### The result — and we publish it whatever it says

Ran the real assessor against the new gold set, three independent times, blind:

| | |
|---|---|
| **QWK 0.93** | vs. a 0.70 conventional bar, 0.60 floor |
| **leniency bias −0.11** | signed, `+` = inflating. It is **harsh**, not lenient |
| **0 of 198 judgments graded UP** | 66 items × 3 runs. **It has never once inflated a grade** |
| **test–retest 0.97** | consistency — which the engine deliberately refuses to accept as validity |
| **verdict `pass`** | so retention figures are not stamped `grader_unvalidated` |

The bug class this whole release was built to catch — a lenient oracle quietly inflating every
retention number — **does not exist in this grader.** It errs only in the safe direction. That
was worth finding out, and it was not knowable before today.

**Weakest case type: `right-answer-wrong-reason` — 52% agreement, bias −0.48.** On productions
that reach the correct conclusion through a broken derivation, the grader is *harsher* than our
adjudication. Whether the grader or the gold set is right there is honestly open, and it ships
written down rather than smoothed away.

**The caveat that matters most:** the gold adjudications are **authored, not independently
human-adjudicated.** Every item carries a written rationale you can dispute, and a dispute is a
first-class contribution (`gold/local-gold.jsonl` overrides ours by `sid`). But an authored gold
set is a weaker instrument than a human-adjudicated one, and saying otherwise would be the exact
dishonesty this feature exists to kill.

### Engine

- **`gold`** — the 66-item gold set, **88% adversarial** (fluent-but-empty, terse-but-correct,
  confident-and-wrong, right-answer-wrong-reason, paraphrase, partial-credit boundary), emitted
  as a **bare array shaped exactly like `stash list`** and **stripped of the answer by
  construction**. The strip is a **whitelist, not a blacklist**: a field added to the gold schema
  later cannot leak by being forgotten in a delete-list.
- **`assessor-audit --file F`** — QWK (**the headline**), raw agreement (**never quoted alone** —
  it overstates chance-corrected agreement by 34–41 points), signed leniency bias, test–retest
  over ≥3 runs, confusion matrix, per-case-type breakdown. Writes `audits/<date>-NN.json`.
- **`grader-health`** — the latest audit's verdict. `stats` embeds it.
- **THE TEETH** — `qwk < 0.60`, `leniency_bias > +0.15`, or the paradox → `grader_unvalidated:
  true` on **every retention figure**, and the stamp goes into the **`read` string** the narrator
  actually speaks, not a nested key only a test ever opens. **An unaudited grader is unvalidated
  too**: it fails toward *"we don't know"*, never toward *"it's fine"*.
- **The consistency–bias paradox gate.** Engram's assessor is *prompted* to be a skeptic, so it
  will be extremely self-consistent — and the literature's central warning is that a judge can
  hit test–retest 0.992 with bias 0.192: perfectly reproducible, systematically wrong. So
  **consistency may never certify.** Above 0.95 test–retest the engine demands leniency strictly
  under the ceiling, and **fewer than three runs cannot pass at all** (`insufficient-runs`).
- **ONE denominator for every number in the audit** — the gold items graded in *every* run.
  A grader that silently drops 20 of 66 sids and nails the rest reports **`incomplete`**, never a
  flattering `QWK 1.00 pass`. (That is issue #3's bug class aimed at the audit itself.)
- **The contamination guard.** If the grader's output carries `gold_grade`, it was *shown*
  `gold_grade` — the audit **dies** rather than certify. A test that hands the subject the answer
  is not a test, and v0.6 shipped a dead feature because a dogfood did exactly that.
- Receipts carry **`grader`** when the assessor states it, and the engine **never invents one**.
  A model naming its own weights is fabricated data; an omitted `grader` stays honestly null.

### The pre-existing crash class this release also fixes — 447 crashes, in shipped code

The v0.7 fuzz gate ran the read paths that v0.6's fuzz list **had never included** — and found
**447 crashes in 300 garbage states on `main`.** Every one in **`next`** and **`topic-status`**:
`nodes` as a string, `order` holding a dict (an unhashable key), a node that is a list.

**`next` is the command `/learn` calls at the start of every session** — the hottest path in the
product. A hand-edited graph could take it down mid-lesson, and it could have done so since v0.1.

The cause has exactly the shape of the original bug: v0.6 put a shape gate in `iter_graphs` —
which every *aggregate* read funnels through — and **`load_graph`, the gate every *single-topic*
command funnels through, never got one.** The v0.6 fuzz list was written from the `/coach`
surface and simply forgot the `/learn` surface. **The list you write is the list you already
thought of.**

- `load_graph` now **refuses** an unusable graph with a fix path, instead of half-reading it. It
  drops and rewrites **nothing** — mutators save what they read, so a lossy "repair" here would be
  a data-loss bug wearing a hard hat.
- `graph_nodes` / `graph_order` — the read views that tolerate partial garbage.
- `apply_item` **refuses** to advance a schedule into a corrupt node rather than write FSRS state
  on top of garbage (receipts are append-only; bad evidence could never be taken back).
- **`reps` and `lapses` were the last two raw arithmetic leaves in the scheduler** — every other
  one already went through `as_number`, and these two did `fsrs.get("reps", 0) + 1` straight.
  A hand-edited `"reps": "many"` raised `TypeError` on the **mutator** path too, so it took `rate`
  down, not just `decay`.
- Fuzz: **891 → 0 crashes across 750 states × 13 read paths (9,750 invocations, 3 seeds).**

### The three selftests that turned out to be theatre

§4.5 (mutation-test every new check) caught **three of this release's own checks** faking it —
the same rate as v0.6, which is the honest news here: *writing a fake check is the default, and
only the mutation test finds it.*

1. **"QWK weights are QUADRATIC"** asserted only that a 2-step error hurts *more* than a 1-step
   one — which **linear weights satisfy just as happily**. Reverting the fix left it green. (And
   a *balanced* confusion matrix is no good either: with equal marginals the two schemes
   normalize to the same kappa and prove nothing.) Now pinned to a hand-computed value on an
   unbalanced matrix carrying both error distances: quadratic → 0.383, linear → 0.407.
2. **"raw agreement is a liar"** did not isolate the QWK floor — its always-says-recalled grader
   trips the *bias* ceiling too, so reverting the floor left it green. Now paired with a **noisy
   but perfectly unbiased** grader (bias exactly 0.00) that only the floor can catch.
3. **"a grader that drops sids"** used three **identical** runs — so the union and the
   intersection of graded sids were the same set, and swapping the honest denominator for the
   flattering one **changed nothing**. Now each run drops a *different* five.

The mutation run also surfaced a **latent crash**: the `pass` read formatted `test_retest` with
`%.2f`, and the only thing between it and a `TypeError` on `None` was a branch three `if`s up the
ladder — a landmine for whoever next edits the verdict order.

And the check harness itself got fixed: **a check that raises now fails BY NAME** instead of
taking the whole suite down. Every mutation of a crash-guard used to report *"the selftest
crashed"* — true, unmissable, and useless for locating which guard you just reverted.

### What the independent reviewer found — 8 defects behind 155 green checks

Every gate above is run by the person who wrote the code, on the code they believe is right.
**That is their structural limit.** §4.6 found eight more, and the worst of them is the one this
release was supposedly *about*.

1. **THE TEETH NEVER REACHED THE HTML DASHBOARD.** `retention.read` was the only carrier of the
   grader stamp, and `cmd_report` rendered it **exclusively in the branch that fires when there
   is no retention data.** On the happy path it drew the bars and threw the stamp away. So a
   grader that inflated every second item produced a **full-width green bar reading 100%**, with
   nothing anywhere on the page to say the grade behind it had failed its own audit —
   `grep -ci 'grader\|unvalidated\|qwk' dashboard.html` → **0**. That is bug class #1 *and* #4, on
   the single surface where a number is most believed. `compute_retention`'s own comment claimed
   the dashboard was covered; the dashboard funnelled through the function and discarded the
   result. **The live test, the fuzz, the numbers audit and the user session all walked straight
   past it — because every one of them reads JSON.** The dashboard now renders the read
   unconditionally, stamps it, and carries a full grader block (QWK · leniency · graded-UP).
2. **`gold_source` — the §4.8 Q5 fix — asserted a provenance that was FALSE.** `gold/local-gold.jsonl`
   overrides bundled adjudications by `sid`, **on the default path, no flag required.** A local
   file that re-grades the set to agree with the grader turns `fail` (QWK 0.55, leniency +0.64)
   into `pass` (QWK 1.00) — and the audit still wrote `"bundled:gold/assessor-gold.jsonl"` into
   the file. **A provenance field that lies is worse than no provenance field, because it is
   believed.** Now `load_gold` counts overrides and additions, `gold_source` names them, and a
   pass against a modified gold set is *stamped as such* on every retention figure.
3. **A grader could mark its own homework twice and keep the better score.** `_run_grades` was
   last-wins, so a grader that got 12 items wrong and re-emitted those sids later in the array —
   *exactly what an LLM self-correcting mid-array produces* — turned `fail` (QWK 0.00, leniency
   +0.67) into `pass` (QWK 1.00), silently, with `n` intact. The mirror image of the dropped-sid
   bug the coverage guard already caught: same class, opposite mechanism. **First verdict stands;
   duplicates are a coverage failure.**
4. **Three copy-pasted runs are indistinguishable from three independent ones.** `test_retest:
   1.00` then *asserts* a reproducibility figure nobody measured — and `MIN_AUDIT_RUNS` and the
   paradox gate, which exist precisely to prevent that, are both satisfied by copy-paste. The
   engine cannot prove independence, so it now refuses to *claim* it: identical runs are flagged
   and named in the read.
5. **The new corrupt-node refusal tore a receipt batch in half.** The `cmd_receipt` pre-flight
   promised *"confirm every node exists before applying ANY, so a bad item can't half-apply the
   batch"* — and checked **existence, not shape.** v0.7 added a `die()` inside `apply_item` that
   the pre-flight didn't screen for, so a 3-item batch with a corrupt middle node **wrote item 1's
   receipt and then died.** Receipts are append-only. A new refusal must be hoisted into the
   pre-flight, or it is not a refusal — it is a tear.
6. **Audit 99 shadowed audit 100.** `sorted()` on `2026-07-11-100.json` puts it *before* `-99.json`,
   so the 100th audit of a day — a `fail` — would be overruled by the 99th, a `pass`. Improbable
   and flattering, which is the worst pair. Now sorted numerically.
7. **The contamination guard falsely accused innocent graders.** It died on any output key named
   `rationale` — the single most natural key for a grader to invent unprompted — *accusing it of
   having been shown the answer* and making the audit unrunnable. Narrowed to `gold_grade` and
   `case_type`, the two keys that could only come from the gold schema.
8. **`leniency_bias` is measured on an 88%-adversarial set**, so it bounds how far the grader
   *can* be pushed; it is not an unbiased estimate of its bias on ordinary productions. The read
   presented it as the latter. Now says so, in the payload.

The reviewer also **independently verified the QWK math** against a closed-form variance
implementation over 4,000 random matrices (max diff 6.7e-16), confirmed the `GRADES`/`GOLD_SCORE`
ordinal trap is not hit, reproduced the crash-class fix (**506 → 0** on its own fuzzer), and read
all 24 `recalled` and all 9 `right-answer-wrong-reason` gold items, finding **no adjudication
error in the lenient direction.**

### Behavior

- **`/coach` reports the oracle before any number it produced.** `unaudited` → one calm line,
  once, and the dashboard still runs. `fail` → said first, plainly, with every retention figure
  named as unearned until it is fixed. **Raw agreement never travels without its QWK.**
- **`/coach audit`** — runs the real assessor on the gold set, three independent times, and
  narrates the engine's verdict. The assessor is **never told it is being audited**: a subject
  that knows it is being tested is not the subject.
- **The §5.6 user session, run against the founder's own state, killed a line before it shipped.**
  It read: *"[grader unaudited — QWK unknown; run /coach audit] insufficient-data (no reviews
  yet)"* — **a caveat on a number that does not exist**, stacked as a second reproach on top of
  *"THE LOOP HAS NEVER CLOSED"*. That is the wall of debt, and the wall of debt is the churn
  trigger, not the cure (`docs/05` P14). The flag stays true in the payload; the narrator is no
  longer handed a disclaimer for a measurement nobody made. **No selftest could have found it. A
  person had to look at the screen.**

### Also

- `audits/` and `gold/` created on `init`. The bundled gold set is **not copied** into the state
  dir — a copy would shadow the plugin's set forever, so a future gold item would never reach an
  existing learner. The plugin's file is the source of truth; `gold/local-gold.jsonl` is additive
  and wins on a `sid` collision, because a human who disputed an adjudication outranks ours.
- Audits are **append-only**, like receipts. A same-day re-audit writes `-02`, never overwrites.
  (`docs/09` §3.4 specified `<date>.json`; destroying evidence to keep a filename tidy is not a
  trade this project makes.)
- A **corrupt latest audit reads `unreadable`** and never falls back to an older, rosier one.
  A stale `pass` is worse than no pass.
- Codex parity: `codex/agents/engram-assessor.toml` carries `grader`, in lockstep.

## 0.6.4 — 2026-07-11 · one definition of "review", and the denominator on the label

Found by running **§7.5 (post-release review)** and **§4.8 (the numbers audit)** of the release
protocol *on the release that added them*. Both are cross-command disagreements: the engine
telling one story in one place and a different story in another, on the same state.

### 1. Four implementations of one rule, three of them wrong

v0.6.1 established the principle — **a node's first receipt is its ENCODING event, whatever it
is labelled** — and fixed it in `_by_node`, which feeds `adherence` and `retention`. It left
`stats.reviews`, `compute_momentum`, `compute_modality` and the calibration split filtering on
`kind == "review"` **directly**.

`rate --kind` defaults to `"review"`, so a bare CLI `rate` on a never-encoded node produced this,
on **one state**:

```
adherence.loop_closure : 0 reviews     ← correct
retention.coverage     : 0 reviews     ← correct
stats.reviews          : 1             ← wrong
modality.dialogue.n    : 1             ← wrong, and it CORRUPTS the medium telemetry:
                                          an ENCODING receipt became a node's "first review",
                                          which is the exact comparison docs/06 exists to make
calibration.n          : 1             ← wrong pool (it is an encode, not a retrieval)
```

Two commands, same state, contradictory answers. **Fixed:** one predicate, `_review_receipts()`,
shared by every counter. `adherence`, `retention`, `stats`, `momentum`, `modality` and both
calibration pools now agree by construction.

*(The three selftests that broke on this fix were themselves the tell: they passed synthetic
receipts carrying **no `topic`/`node` at all** — fixtures that had never been shaped like real
data. They were rewritten as real receipt streams.)*

### 2. The denominator was not on the label

Three surfaces reported "current recall" and meant different populations:

```
retention.unmeasured.projected_recall_now : 56%   over the PAST-DUE nodes
session hook ("those N sit at ~X%")       : 56%   over the PAST-DUE nodes
decay.now.mean_recall                     : 66%   over ALL ENCODED nodes
```

**Neither number was lying. The labels were.** Both are correct for what they measure, and a
learner comparing them could not possibly tell which to believe. `decay` now ships
`mean_recall_due` beside `mean_recall`, with a `population` string naming each denominator — and
the three surfaces reconcile exactly.

### Engine (selftest 127 → 129)

Both fixes selftested and **mutation-tested**. A new check asserts the cross-command agreement
directly, so the four counters can never drift apart again.

No schema change, no migration.

## 0.6.3 — 2026-07-11 · what a real session found

The release protocol gained a gate it never had — **§5.6, the user session: stop testing, be a
learner, and write down how it felt.** This is the first release to pass through it, and it found
three things that 126 selftests, a fuzzer, two adversarial reviews and an agent dogfood all
walked straight past — because none of them *reads the sentence as a human*.

Full report: `docs/user-sessions/v0.6.2.md`.

### The seven-minute silence

The curriculum architect took **~7 minutes of completely silent terminal** before the first
question. No spinner, no "this takes a minute", nothing. That silence lands *before the learner
has seen a single thing this product does well* — and it is, by a distance, the most likely
moment a first-time user closes the tab. A stranger will not stare at a blank screen for seven
minutes on faith.

**`/learn` now sets the expectation before it spawns the architect.** One line of prose, and it
is the highest-value change in this release.

### `decay` told you reviewing was pointless

With nothing yet due, `decay` reported:

> *"1 concept encoded; 0.4 expected to survive 30 days untouched, 0.4 if reviewed today
> (0 minutes) — **a difference of 0.0**"*

Arithmetically correct — nothing is due, so there is nothing to review today. **Rhetorically the
exact opposite of the truth**: a learner reads *"a difference of 0.0"* and concludes reviewing
buys nothing. This is the same bug class v0.6.1/v0.6.2 are named for — a number that misleads —
simply pointing the other way. It now says:

> *"1 concept encoded, none due yet — nothing to save today. The schedule brings each one back
> just before it fades; 0.6 of 1 are expected to survive the next 30 days on that schedule."*

### Two adjacent sections both called "Retention"

The dashboard put *"Retention — recall by days since you first learned it"* directly above
*"Retention by memory strength"*, and a user cannot tell which is the real number. The older view
is renamed and demoted.

### Engine (selftest 126 → 127)

- `decay` with an empty due queue emits an honest read instead of a discouraging zero. Selftest
  added and **mutation-tested**.
- **The dashboard could be killed by a hand-edited `state`.** `cmd_report` tested `st not in
  STATE_DOTS` without coercing first — an unhashable value (`state: {}`) raises `TypeError` and
  takes `/coach`'s HTML down. `state_counts()` was guarded for exactly this and `cmd_report` was
  not. **Caught by the §4.7 fuzz gate on its first run under the new protocol** — 35 crashes / 500
  states, from a generator shape the previous sweep never produced. Now **0 / 900 across 3 seeds**,
  with an unhashable-state fixture added to the read-path check.

  *(And the first version of that check was itself theatre — the fixture's `order` didn't list the
  new nodes, so `cmd_report` never visited them. §4.5 caught it. The gates catch the gates.)*

### Release protocol

`RELEASE_PROTOCOL.md` substantially rewritten around what actually caught bugs across v0.5–v0.6:

- **The bug classes this repo cannot ship** — led by *a number wrong in the flattering direction*,
  because a crash gets fixed and a flattering number gets believed.
- **§4.5 mutation-test every new check** — three of ours were theatre (one asserted a constant;
  one had a fixture where the old and new definitions agreed by coincidence).
- **§4.7 the fuzz gate** — 0 crashes / 500 type-corrupt states. Read paths degrade; `doctor`
  reports corruption and must never die of what it exists to find.
- **§4.8 the numbers audit** — five questions, answered in writing, for every number a release
  adds. Question 1 is *"do the engine's own commands agree with each other?"* — `retention` once
  said 100% while `decay` said 56%, and nobody had ever run them side by side.
- **§5.5 the dogfood must be UNCONTAMINATED** — give each agent exactly what the real skill gives
  it. Ours once *certified* a dead feature because the prompt handed the assessor the answer.
- **§5.6 the user session** — the gate this release is named for. Its verdict is **binding**: if
  you would not hand it to a stranger, it does not ship, however green the tests are.
- **§7.5 the post-release review** — because the two worst v0.6 bugs were found in *shipped* code.

No schema change, no migration.

## 0.6.2 — 2026-07-11 · the honest denominator was not honest

Four defects in released v0.6.0/v0.6.1, found by an **independent reviewer working from the
shipped code** — none of them in the nine the pre-release review caught. Two are the same
failure mode this release was written to eliminate, hiding inside the machinery written to
eliminate it.

### 1. HIGH — the honest denominator exempted anyone who reviewed once, ever

`retention.unmeasured` counted concepts that came due and were **never reviewed**. So a node
was exempted the *moment* it was retrieved even once — forever after.

Reproduced on shipped code: encode ten concepts, review all ten at day 7 (all recalled), then
vanish for 200 days.

```
retention.read   : "measured over 10 retrievals"      buckets: 7d n=10, rate 1.0
unmeasured       : 0
coverage         : complete
loop_closure     : "the loop is closing"

the engine's OWN decay command, on the same state:
  10 concepts due · mean current recall 56%
```

The dashboard reported **100% recall, nothing unmeasured, loop closing** while ten concepts sat
at 56% and falling. That is *"survivorship bias with a progress bar"* — this block's own
docstring — reproduced **inside the block written to prevent it**. The `coverage` guard could
not see it either: coverage counts *reviews*, and every review here bucketed perfectly.

**Fixed.** The denominator is now everything **past due right now** (`past_due_now`), with
`never_reviewed` kept as a sub-count. A node past due *now* has, by definition, not been
retrieved since it came due — whatever its history. And the debt now reaches the **narrator**,
not just a nested key: every `read` string carries it, because a `read` of *"measured over 10
retrievals"* while ten concepts rot is precisely the lie.

### 2. HIGH — the normal settle path destroyed a second, ungraded production

v0.6.0 fixed `drop_stash(topic, node)` on the rare **idempotent no-op** branch and left it live
on the branch that runs on **every single settle**. `stash add` appends without deduping on
node, so a node can legitimately hold two productions (a re-attempt, a park-and-resume, a slow
assessor). Settling the first drained *both*:

```
stash before : [P1, P2 — second attempt, never graded]
settle P1    -> stash after: []          P2 is gone. Never assessed, never a receipt.
```

The exact data loss that was fixed on the rare path, still live on the common one. **Fixed:**
a settle drains only its own `sid`; the legacy sid-less `rate` path keeps its self-drain.

### 3. MEDIUM — `kind` was unvalidated, and the two entry points disagreed on its default

`rate --kind` defaulted to `"review"`; `cmd_receipt` defaulted to `"encode"`; neither validated
it. Every v0.6 metric keys off the exact literal `"review"`, so a typo'd or invented kind is
permanently invisible to `loop_closure`, every retention bucket, calibration and `stats.reviews`
— and **unfixable**, because receipts are append-only. This was also the root cause of v0.6.1.
**Fixed:** a `KINDS` constant, `choices=` on the flag, and validation in `validate_item`, so a
bad batch dies before any write.

### 4. LOW
- A backward clock step could stamp a **negative** `days_since_encode` into an append-only
  receipt, permanently. Clamped to ≥ 0.
- `commit --clear --cue X --action Y` silently *cleared* (the `elif` made the set-branch
  unreachable). Now refused.

### Engine (selftest 120 → 126)

Six new checks, every one **mutation-tested** — reverted to the broken behaviour to confirm it
actually fails. Verified against the founder's real state: all numbers unchanged and now
*mutually consistent* (`retention` and `decay` both report 70%), state byte-identical.

No schema migration. `retention.unmeasured.past_due_never_reviewed` is replaced by
`past_due_now` + `never_reviewed`; nothing outside this repo consumed it (v0.6 is hours old).

## 0.6.1 — 2026-07-11 · loop_closure could lie in the one direction that matters

A defect in v0.6.0, found by an independent reviewer after release. It is small, it is
narrow, and it is exactly the kind this release cannot tolerate — **the metric built to say
*"you never came back"* could say the opposite.**

`rate`'s `--kind` argparse default is `"review"`. The skills always pass an explicit
`--kind`, so the documented flows are unaffected — but a bare CLI `rate --topic t --node a
--rating good` writes that node's **only** receipt as `kind: review`. `_by_node` then treated
that single receipt as *both* the node's day-0 encoding event *and* a retention test, so:

```
loop_closure:  1 of 1  ·  rate 1.0  ·  "the loop is closing"
```

…for a learner who had **never come back once**. `retention` likewise counted it as a day-0
retrieval.

**The fix is a principle, not a patch: a node's FIRST receipt is its encoding event, whatever
it happens to be labelled.** There was no prior memory to retain, so a first exposure cannot
be a retention test and must never count toward `loop_closure` or a retention bucket. A
genuine second retrieval still closes the loop, exactly as before.

Wrong numbers are the only bug class this project is not allowed to ship. A number that is
wrong in the *flattering* direction — telling a learner their loop is closing when they have
abandoned it — is the worst instance of it.

### Engine (selftest 119 → 120)
- `_by_node`: the first receipt is never appended to a node's `reviews` list. Covered by a
  selftest that asserts both directions (a once-touched node reads `NEVER CLOSED`; a real
  second retrieval reads `1.0`), and mutation-tested to confirm it fails without the fix.

No schema change, no migration, no default change.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-07-11 · the loop closes

Engram has been an excellent **encoding** machine bolted to a **retention** machine that
never ran. This release is about the second half.

The finding that forced it, found by reading the author's own state: on 2026-07-05 he ran a
45-minute `/learn` on transformer internals. The architect built a 13-node DAG, the tutor ran
generation-first dialogue, the smith built an explorable, the blind assessor graded six
productions and honestly rounded most down to `partial`. Seven concepts encoded, seven review
dates booked. **Then nobody came back.** Six days later: zero reviews, zero streak, seven items
overdue, one session in the log — ever. Meanwhile 501 people starred the repo.

Run Engram's own FSRS curve over Engram's own state and it says: those seven decay to **2.7 of 7
over the next 30 days untouched, or hold at 5.6 of 7 if the four-minute review happens** — a
difference of 2.9 concepts. The engine could always compute both numbers. Its entire ambient
surface, on the sixth day of a memory dying on schedule, was `[engram] 7 reviews due`.

This is not a story about a lazy user. It is the product's own failure mode executing perfectly
on the person most invested in it, which makes it architectural rather than personal.

Three gaps, each confirmed by reading the code rather than the docs:

- **The north star was never implemented.** `docs/04` named "7-day and 30-day retention on
  scheduled reviews" the north star in Phase 0. `grep` found no such metric. `stats` bucketed by
  memory *strength*, never elapsed *time*. **Naming a metric is not measuring it.**
- **Adherence was invisible.** No signal anywhere for *"was this encoded concept ever reviewed?"*
  The system could not see its own binding constraint.
- **`receipt --file` was not idempotent** (issue #3) — a crash-retry between `receipt` and
  `stash clear` double-counted reps permanently.

### Engine (selftest 86 → 119)

- **`adherence`** — the funnel Engram never looked at: `loop_closure` (encoded → came due →
  actually reviewed), `return` (session cadence, days since last), `funnel` (topic → encoded →
  due → reviewed → retained@30d). Pure read over data already on disk; no schema change.
  **`loop_closure` is the binding-constraint number: the value a learning system produces is
  Return × Encoding × Retention × Transfer, and those terms multiply — a perfect encoder with
  zero return is worth exactly zero.**
- **`retention`** — the north star, finally computed. Recall bucketed by each review's own
  days-since-first-encode, in windows that **partition [0, ∞)** so no review is ever dropped:
  `early` 0–3 (still re-encoding — reported, *never* pooled into a retention claim) · `7d` 4–14 ·
  **`30d` 15–59 (the headline)** · `90d` 60–179 · `180d+`. Ships two honesty guards:
  - **`unmeasured`** — the concepts that came due and were *never reviewed*. Their recall is
    **unknown, not absent**, and FSRS projects it. A retention figure computed only over
    *completed* reviews silently drops exactly the concepts the learner abandoned — survivorship
    bias with a progress bar. The engine refuses to report one without the other.
  - **`coverage`** — `reviews_bucketed / reviews_total`, which must be 1.0. This exists because
    the *first* cut of this feature used disjoint windows (5–10 / 25–40 / 80–110) and **the live
    test caught a real day-11 review falling into a gap and vanishing** — `retention` cheerfully
    reported "no reviews yet" with a review sitting on disk. Under real FSRS intervals (~4d, ~12d,
    ~30d, ~70d) most reviews would have landed in those holes and the north star would have been
    computed on an arbitrary subset of the evidence. A metric that quietly discards data is worse
    than no metric. Now selftested by sweeping 19 elapsed-day values across the full range.
- **`decay`** — what is dying and what N minutes would save, in real FSRS numbers. Both arms
  measured over the *same future window*, so it is a comparison rather than a rhetorical device.
  The `due` payload now carries `last`, so current recall is computed from the learner's **actual**
  last retrieval rather than reconstructed from `interval_for(s, 0.90) + overdue` — a
  reconstruction that silently breaks for anyone who moved `desired_retention` (measured: **3.3
  percentage points of *overstated* decay** at 0.97) and breaks in the one direction an honesty
  feature is not permitted to err in: alarming the learner.
- **`commit`** — the learner's implementation intention, in their own words (Gollwitzer & Sheeran
  2006: 94 tests, N > 8,000, **d = 0.65**, robust to publication-bias correction). Stored because
  they said it, shown back at the moment it names, **never enforced**.
- **`sid` — receipts are idempotent** (closes #3). The stash id rides stash → assessor → receipt;
  `apply_item` refuses one already on disk. Additive: a receipt without a `sid` applies exactly as
  in v0.5.
- **`days_since_encode`** stamped on every receipt — makes the north star a one-pass query.
- **Fixed a latent race, present since v0.5:** `report` and `doctor` called `load_model()`, which
  *persists* a self-heal — while holding no lock. An unlocked read could flush a stale snapshot
  over a concurrent locked mutator, silently reverting a `refit`. New `read_model()` heals in
  memory and never writes. Covered by a selftest that fails without it.
- **Receipt log is cached per process, keyed by absolute path.** A batch settle re-read the whole
  topic log once *per item* — measured at 1.85s for a 60-item settle against a 10k-line log, now
  0.19s. The cache is keyed by path (never by topic alone, or a second `ENGRAM_HOME` would read
  the first one's receipts) and kept in sync on append, so a duplicate `sid` appearing later in
  the *same* batch is still caught. Both properties have selftests.
- **Read paths now degrade instead of bricking — a whole class of crashes, several pre-existing.**
  Fuzzing 3,000 randomized garbage states found **259 unhandled crashes in the first 300**. A
  hand-edited state file can be perfectly valid JSON with the *wrong types*: `nodes` as a string,
  `fsrs` as a list, an unhashable `topic`, a `rating` that is a dict — and every one of those
  raised `TypeError`/`AttributeError` and took `stats` down with it, and therefore `/coach`.
  Several predate this release (`compute_momentum` since v0.4, `due_items` and `compute_streak`
  since v0.1, `_outcome` since v0.3, `compute_modality` since v0.5); v0.6 *widened* the blast
  radius by making `stats` call `adherence` and `retention` too. The fix is one gate, not twenty
  patches: **`iter_graphs` now validates the graph's shape** and skips what is structurally
  unusable, because every read path funnels through it. `doctor` still reads graphs raw — it is
  the thing that *reports* corruption, and it must never die of what it is there to find.
  **Now 0 crashes / 3,000 states**, locked in by a selftest that feeds every read path a
  deliberately type-corrupt state and demands they all return.

### What the adversarial review caught that the tests, the live test, and the dogfood all missed

Protocol step 4.5 earned its place again. **Nine defects behind a green selftest, an exhaustive
live test, and a passing agent dogfood** — and the worst of them was one the dogfood had actively
*certified*:

- **Issue #3 was not actually fixed.** The `sid` never survived the assessor, because
  `agents/engram-assessor.md` declares a *strict* output schema that never mentioned it. The
  guard was dead code in the shipped pipeline. **The dogfood "passed" only because the prompt
  written for it told the assessor to pass the field through — an instruction the real `/learn`
  skill never gives.** A test that hands the subject the answer is not a test. The `sid` is now
  part of the assessor's contract (Claude *and* Codex ports), `/learn` step 4 checks it came back
  before applying, and the round-trip has been re-verified with the real agent and **no hint**.
- **The idempotent "no-op" was a data-loss bug.** It called `drop_stash(topic, node)`, which
  drains *every* stash entry for that node — so a crash-retry would silently destroy a second,
  newer, never-graded production. The guard written to prevent corruption would have corrupted.
  Now drops only its own `sid`.
- **`decay --topic <unknown>` returned a confident false all-clear** ("nothing to lose") instead
  of erroring. From a command whose entire job is honest accounting, that is the worst available
  failure mode. It now refuses.
- **`decay` overstated its own headline.** The benefit arm simulated reviewing *every encoded
  node* while pricing `minutes` from the *due queue only*. The not-yet-due nodes now keep their
  own curve in both arms — you are quoted exactly what those minutes buy.
- **The `coverage` guard was inert.** It was computed, stored in a nested key, and read by
  nobody — so the anti-data-loss check could not actually prevent the regression it existed for.
  An incomplete partition now hijacks `read` with **UNTRUSTWORTHY** in the one field a narrator
  is guaranteed to see.
- **Two contradictory definitions of "retained at 30 days" shipped in the same payload** —
  `funnel.nodes_retained_30d` used `>= 25` days while `retention`'s 30d bucket is `[15, 59]`.
  One definition now, from one source.
- **A receipt with a missing `ts` sorted first** and became a node's day-0 anchor, poisoning
  every elapsed-day metric downstream. Broken timestamps now sort last.
- **`median_gap_days` was not a median** (it took the upper element on even-length lists).
- **The dashboard never showed any of it.** `/coach`'s HTML still headlined a strength-bucketed
  retention with no `unmeasured` denominator. It now opens with `loop_closure` and states the
  concepts that came due and were never reviewed.

Each has a selftest, and each selftest was **mutation-tested** — reverted to the broken behavior
to confirm it actually fails. Two first drafts turned out to be theatre (one asserted a constant
instead of a behavior; one had a fixture where the old and new definitions coincided by
coincidence) and were rebuilt until the regression is genuinely caught.

### Behavior

- **The ambient hook now says what the decay costs** — but only as a *return event*: it fires on a
  never-closed loop or after a real absence, never per-session. *"Those 7 sit at ~70% recall and
  still falling · 4 min now is the difference between keeping them and re-learning them."*
  **Information, never pressure** (`docs/05` P13). No should, no scold, and
  `settings.decay_notice = "off"` silences it entirely.
- **`/review`** states the honest number once on return — *after* amnesty, *before* the capped
  offer. The order is: nothing is owed → here is what it costs → here is a two-minute path.
  Reversed, it is a debt collector.
- **`/learn` books the return** — one plain question at the close, their words, stored via
  `commit`, never enforced, never asked twice.
- **`/coach` reports `loop_closure` FIRST.** When it is zero it says so plainly and stops: there
  is no point narrating calibration over a loop that has never run.

### Docs

- **`docs/07-the-measured-loop.md`** — the frontier audit. Learning rate is close to a category
  error (Koedinger 2023 *PNAS*, replicated EDM 2024: intercept variance dwarfs slope variance —
  you cannot make people climb faster, only give them more climbs; the 2026 re-analysis contesting
  the *magnitude* is recorded too). LLM-as-judge is **"reliability without validity"** (κ ≈
  0.38–0.51 vs humans; raw agreement overstates chance-corrected κ by 34–41 points; **high
  self-consistency + high bias is the documented failure mode** — precisely what a skeptic-prompted
  assessor selects for). Pan & Rickard 2018: retrieval transfers at d = 0.40, but **d = 0.28 when
  the response format differs vs d = 0.58 when it matches** — a quantified critique of verbal-only
  review for doing-goals. The n-of-1 machinery is **underpowered ~2.5×**.
- **`docs/08-vision.md`** — the objective function, which metrics are traps (confidence and joy
  both are), and the final state: Tutor → Instrument → Commons. Adds **Article 11: the system's
  success is measured by what the learner can do without it.**
- **`docs/09-target-architecture.md`** · **`docs/10-roadmap-to-1.0.md`** — schemas, invariants, and
  v0.6 → v1.0 as executable work orders.
- `docs/04` marked complete and superseded.

### Migration

None. Every field is additive and self-heals: a v0.5 (or v0.3) learner model gains
`commitment: null` and `decay_notice: "on"` on next load and behaves exactly as before. Receipts
without a `sid` apply as they always did. Nothing to migrate, nothing to delete.

## 0.5.2 — 2026-07-11 · confidence before the verdict, not after

Reported from real use (#4 — thank you, @kosh-jelly): at VERIFY the tutor praised the
answer — *"that's a complete, well-integrated answer…"* — and **then** fired the
confidence picker. A sureness collected after the learner has been told they nailed it
is not sureness; it is an echo of the verdict. Confidence-before-feedback exists to
measure calibration and to catch high-confidence errors for hypercorrection — both die
the instant any signal of correctness reaches the learner first.

The intent was never in doubt: the picker itself asks *"before I show the answer."* The
prose had a seam. The gate was worded around the **reveal** ("before you reveal or
grade", "no canonical answer until confidence"), and `/learn`'s VERIFY step granted
*"immediate content feedback is yours to give"* right beside it. So the model did what a
careful reading allowed — withheld the canonical answer, kept the picker's framing
honest, and let the *evaluation* through. The pretest step one screen up already had the
tight wording ("before saying anything about correctness"); VERIFY did not.

### Behavior (prose only; selftest unchanged, 86 → 86)
- **`/learn` VERIFY** (`skills/learn/SKILL.md`): the pick fires **first**, gated on
  "before you say a word about correctness," with the exact failure banned by example
  (*"that's complete," "close," "nice"*). "Immediate content feedback is yours to give"
  moved to **after** the pick; the pick is now also stated to precede the stash (its
  value is a stash field, so it cannot come later).
- **Confidence-integrity rule** (`skills/_shared/dialogue-grammar.md`): "feedback"
  redefined as *any* signal of correctness — approving tone included — not just the
  shown answer.
- **Anti-sycophancy oath** (same file, hard rules): the gate broadened from "no
  canonical answer until confidence" to "no verdict — not even a bare *'that's right'* —
  until confidence is collected."
- **Terse-production move** (same file): at VERIFY the *"credit what's there"* step now
  waits until after the confidence pick — closing the one path (a fragment answer) where
  the sharpened rule would otherwise still leak a correctness signal first. Found by this
  release's own adversarial review, not in the wild.

No engine touched: whether the tutor asks in the right order is a dialogue property,
provable only by a live VERIFY, not a selftest. The old order didn't merely mis-sequence
the question — it recorded a corrupted "Certain" as real calibration data. Putting the
pick first is the fix; there is no unit test that can stand in for using it.

## 0.5.1 — 2026-07-10 · the modality confound, said out loud

Found by doing what the release protocol asks and 0.5.0 skipped: a real `/learn`
session, driven end to end with the actual agents. The pipeline held up — the
curriculum architect tagged every node's visual affordance, the artifact-smith built a
Contract-v2 explorable for the threshold node and registered it unprompted, the blind
assessor rounded a shaky production down to `partial`, and the receipt carried its
medium stamp. But the session exposed something no code review could: **the medium
comparison in `stats.modality` is confounded by construction.**

Explorables are routed to threshold and high-affordance concepts *on purpose* — that
is the whole content rule. So the dialogue arm fills with the remaining material, and
the two arms never differ only in medium. Under `threshold-only` the explorable arm is
exactly the topic's hardest, portal concepts. A lower explorable-arm recall may mean
nothing more than that explorables were spent on the hard things.

The number was already labeled suggestive. That was not enough: a coach narrating from
the JSON could report it as a clean result. So the caveat now travels *with* the data.

### Engine (selftest 85 → 86)
- `stats.modality` gains a **`caveat`** field, present in every read state
  (`insufficient-data` included), stating that the arms are not randomized and the
  comparison carries medium *and* material. Covered by a new selftest — a narrator
  reading only this JSON cannot see the verdict without seeing why it is soft.
- The dashboard's "Encoding medium" section prints the caveat beside the bars, so a
  learner reading the HTML alone gets the same warning.

### Behavior
- `/coach` **must voice** the caveat whenever it reports the medium yield, and is
  explicitly forbidden from presenting the number as proof the medium works or fails.
  Sample narration updated to model the honest version.

### Theory
- `docs/06-visual-encoding.md` open question 2 now documents the confound in full,
  including why it *cannot* be fixed by randomizing arms without violating the content
  rule the document itself establishes — and names the honest form of the question
  (a randomized `experiment` within one affordance class; future work).

### Examples
- `examples/pid-error-feedback-loop.html` — the explorable the artifact-smith actually
  generated in that session (drone altitude hold; a wind gust drives the error, the
  throttle answers), now hosted next to the hand-authored reference implementation.
  Its header says which is which, because "the kind of thing Engram builds" and "the
  thing Engram built" are not the same claim.

No schema change, no default change, nothing to migrate.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-07-10 · the visual-encoding layer — explorables audited, adaptive, and measured

The explorable engine grows up. Until now, interactive explorables fired only on
threshold nodes — which conflated *importance* with *visualizability* — the graph never
recorded which artifacts existed (the smith wrote files nothing tracked), and nothing
measured whether the medium actually works for a given learner. v0.5 fixes all three,
under a new adversarially-verified evidence base.

### Theory
- **New: `docs/06-visual-encoding.md`** — the visual-encoding audit, built the same way
  as docs/05: a fan-out research pass (27 primary sources, 135 claims extracted, the 25
  load-bearing ones each verified by three refute-first voters; 23 survived, 2 killed).
  Adds **Pillar 15 — the guided manipulable**: manipulable models carry the largest
  verified interactivity effect (simulations g+ = 0.62), but *guidance inside the
  artifact is the active ingredient* (scaffolded versions of the same simulation
  g+ = 0.60; learner control per se g = 0.05 ≈ nothing; unassisted discovery loses,
  d = −0.38), the payoff concentrates where the dynamics ARE the content
  (representational d = 0.40 vs decorative ≈ −0.05), and expertise reversal is a
  confirmed disordinal crossover (+0.505 novices / −0.428 knowledgeable, Tetzlaff 2025).
  Two refuted claims are recorded as do-not-build-on; four areas that produced no
  verifiable evidence (visual retrieval formats, n-of-1 medium methodology,
  preference-engagement value, LLM-artifact efficacy) are stated as **open questions**
  with deliberately conservative design stances.
- **Explorable Contract v2** (same seven clauses, sharpened by the audit): the
  manipulable is now explicitly *guided* — predict → act → **explain** micro-cycle
  (self-explanation g = 0.46), content-relevant degrees of freedom only, a **worked
  drive** gates the model at novice scaffold (worked examples g = 0.48; "provide
  assistance when in doubt"); no text over motion; learner advances *between* segments,
  dynamics run themselves *within* one; registration is part of clause 7. New widget:
  **feature-space navigator** (several sliders, each a dimension; one holistic output
  morphing live — the founder's draggable-face moment, now in the vocabulary).

### Engine (`scripts/engram.py`) — selftest 70 → 85
- **`artifact set|clear|list`** — explorable registration is now engine-owned like
  `fsrs`/`state`: the file must exist, paths under the state dir are stored
  home-relative, payload-supplied `artifact` values are stripped at `add-topic`, and
  registrations survive `--replace` alongside the schedule. (Fixes a real gap: built
  artifacts were invisible to the graph, so regeneration tracking and Contract clause 7
  had no data trail.)
- **Medium-stamped receipts** — every `rate`/`receipt` stamps whether the node had a
  registered explorable *at grading time*, so evidence of the encoding medium can never
  be rewritten retroactively.
- **`stats.modality`** — the honest per-learner answer to "do explorables work for ME":
  first-review recall of explorable-encoded vs dialogue-only nodes, one datum per node,
  ≥6 per arm (the n-of-1 experiment floor) before any verdict; reads
  `explorable-encoded ahead / dialogue-encoded ahead / indistinguishable /
  insufficient-data`. Also rendered as an "Encoding medium" dashboard section. This is
  the instrument the Phase-2 exit criterion (docs/04) always called for.
- **`visuals eager|threshold|off|status`** — the discoverable dial over
  `settings.artifacts`, sibling to `focus`. `eager` extends explorables beyond threshold
  nodes to any node whose *content* declares high visual affordance. Default remains
  `threshold-only`: existing users see zero behavior change.
- **`viz` node field** — the curriculum architect now declares each node's visual
  affordance (`affordance high|some|none`, `kind`, one-line manipulation `hook`);
  the engine stores it opaquely (object kept, garbage dropped with a warning).
- `due` payload now carries an `artifact` presence flag (review's re-encode path reads
  it); `doctor` notes unregistered artifact files with the exact fix command (non-failing)
  and fails dangling registrations.

### Behavior (skills + agents; defaults unchanged)
- `/learn`: explorables are now **content-triggered and learner-dialed** — threshold
  nodes as before; at `visuals eager`, also `viz.affordance: high` nodes; an explicit
  "make it visual" builds for any node at any level (autonomy override, same shape as
  "just tell me"). One **ask-once-per-topic** offer when a high-affordance node meets the
  default setting (arrow-key; "always" sets `visuals eager` with consent echoed back).
  The smith now runs **in the background** while the dialogue beats continue, registers
  what it builds, and hand-off is an arrow-key choice (open it now / homework — homework
  is the Sprint default; the two-minute floor outranks the medium).
- `/review`: the second-lapse re-encode move now knows whether an explorable already
  exists (regenerate it differently) or not (offer to build one) — background spawn,
  hand-off at the close, never mid-queue.
- `/coach`: narrates the medium comparison when it has a verdict, with its n and the
  explicit honesty that n-of-1 medium measurement is suggestive telemetry, not settled
  methodology; offers the matching `visuals` move arrow-key style, applied only on yes.
- curriculum-architect (both platforms): declares `viz` per node with an evidence leash —
  a false `high` is worse than a false `none`, because decorative interactivity reverses
  the effect (≈ −0.05).
- artifact-smith (both platforms): consumes `viz.kind`/`viz.hook`, applies the novice
  worked-drive gate, registers after writing, echoes the registration JSON in its report.

### Hardening (adversarial review before release — 10 confirmed findings, all fixed)
- **State mutex.** Every state-mutating command now serializes on an advisory
  lockfile (`.engram.lock`; stale locks broken after 60s). The new background
  artifact-smith registering while the tutor rates on the same topic was a
  last-writer-wins race on the whole-file graph write — it could silently revert
  a just-graded node's schedule or drop a fresh registration.
- **The `valid_artifact` gate.** Receipt stamping, the due-payload flag, and
  `--replace` carry-forward now all require a non-empty string whose file exists.
  v0.4's `add-topic` silently kept payload-supplied artifact strings; without the
  gate those phantoms would stamp append-only receipts into the wrong modality arm
  forever. Registration also now survives a corrupt `fsrs` on restructure (it was
  being destroyed), and phantoms die at `--replace` instead of living on.
- **doctor** reports all artifact problems (unregistered, dangling, garbage-typed)
  as *notes* with pasteable shell-quoted fix commands — an upgrade must not flip
  doctor red for v0.4's own leniency.
- **Input hardening:** `artifact list` degrades gracefully on nodeless graphs and
  lists registrations on nodes outside `order`; `visuals status` reports a
  hand-edited non-string setting instead of crashing; `add-topic` rejects a
  non-object node with a clean error.
- README's `visuals` CLI row described the levels in swapped order (taught
  `eager` = default) — fixed. Selftest 79 → 85 across the fixes.

### Packaging
- Version 0.5.0 everywhere (plugin.json ×2, badges); README: science point 6, visual
  FAQ entry, CLI table rows for `visuals`/`artifact`, docs table row for docs/06,
  Discord community badge (discord.gg/temm1e); INSTALL-CODEX selftest count 85/85.

Existing users: `claude plugin marketplace update engram && claude plugin update
engram@engram`, then restart Claude Code. A v0.4 learner model self-heals; nothing
about your schedule, receipts, or defaults changes until you touch the `visuals` dial.
Optional one-time heal: `doctor` will point out any explorable built before 0.5 so you
can register it (`artifact set …`) and start counting it in the medium comparison.

## 0.4.4 — 2026-07-09 · fix the confidence picker not firing (contradiction in the oath)

0.4.3 added the imperative picker instruction but a stale line survived in the most-obeyed
section — the anti-sycophancy **oath** still read *"Confidence in the same breath as the
probe"*, which tells the tutor to ask for a number inline (the "Answer + 0-100" a user saw
on 0.4.3). It overrode the new rule. The ⚠ section and beats were updated in 0.4.2/0.4.3;
this oath line was missed.

### Behavior (dialogue grammar; no engine change)
- The oath line is replaced with **"Confidence is a picker, never a typed number"**, and
  the **reveal is now gated on it**: no canonical answer until confidence is collected via
  `AskUserQuestion` (or a volunteered number, or dismissed → null). Gating on the reveal —
  an action the tutor always performs — is the most reliable way to make the tool call fire,
  versus a standalone "please call the picker".
- Removed every remaining "answer + 0–100 / gut number" cue from probe-prompt guidance.

## 0.4.3 — 2026-07-09 · make the confidence picker actually fire

0.4.2 described the confidence picker but left the instruction too soft and framed it
as a fallback *after* a text ask — so the tutor kept asking for a typed number instead
of showing the arrow-key box. Fixed by adopting the production-grade pattern: an
imperative MUST, the explicit `AskUserQuestion(...)` call inlined in the dialogue
grammar, and no "give a number" wording left in any probe prompt.

### Behavior (grammar + skills; no engine change)
- The four-band Confidence picker (Certain 90 / Pretty sure 70 / Half unsure 50 /
  Just guessing 25) is now the **primary, mandatory** way confidence is collected —
  before the reveal, every item — with the tool's built-in "Other" for an exact number
  or skip (→ null). The tutor only skips the picker if the learner volunteered a number
  unprompted. Applied to `/learn` encode, the pretest, and `/review`.
- Verified live: the picker renders and a selection round-trips to its number.

## 0.4.2 — 2026-07-09 · confidence UX — pick, don't type

Collecting the 0–100 gut-confidence (which powers calibration and hypercorrection —
kept, because it earns its place) used to force the learner to *type a number* every
item, then nagged with a text re-ask if they skipped it. Friction the data can't afford.

### Behavior (dialogue grammar + skills; no engine change)
- **Confidence is now a one-tap pick, not a typed number.** It's offered as an optional
  add-on in the same breath as the probe (type `…, about 70` if you like). If you give no
  number, a picker (AskUserQuestion) appears **before the reveal** with four bands —
  Certain (90) / Pretty sure (70) / Half unsure (50) / Just guessing (25), plus Other for
  an exact number or skip. Dismiss → `null`, still never estimated.
- **Guardrails made explicit** so the convenience stays honest and bugless: the picker
  fires *before* feedback every time (confidence-after-answer is discarded as null); a
  picked band is the learner's own stated confidence, not an invented one; and confidence
  is *metadata, not knowledge*, so a menu is allowed there while the probe stays open
  free-recall. Applied consistently across `/learn` encode, the pretest, and `/review`.

## 0.4.1 — 2026-07-09 · discoverable Focus mode + release hygiene

Follow-up to 0.4.0: the ADHD Focus profile shipped but was undiscoverable (no README,
no clean command), and one toggle path was buggy.

### Engine
- **`focus on|off|status` command** — a first-class, discoverable wrapper over
  `model --set settings.profile=...`. Turning it on flips the ADHD profile (Sprint
  default, competence growth surfaced every review, always-on amnesty); `status` reports
  without changing anything.
- **Bug fix: `model --set <key>=null` now clears to real `None`**, not the string
  `"null"` — so turning Focus (or any nullable setting) *off* actually works. `null`/`none`
  (any case) are recognized alongside the existing int/float/bool casts.
- Selftests 68 -> **70** (the `focus` on/off round-trip; the `=null` clear).

### Docs
- **README now documents Focus mode** (FAQ entry + CLI table row) with both activation
  paths: say "I have ADHD, turn on focus mode" in `/learn`/`/coach`, or run `focus on`.
  This omission is what prompted the fix — a shipped feature nobody can find isn't shipped.
- **`RELEASE_PROTOCOL.md`** added at root: the repeatable release checklist (version-bump
  locations, selftest gate, a live dogfood test, and the merge → tag → `gh release` steps),
  written after v0.4.0 shipped with its files bumped but no git tag / release cut.
- `INSTALL-CODEX.md` selftest count corrected (68 -> 70).

## 0.4.0 — 2026-07-09 · the affective layers (motivation + wisdom)

Two new layers around the unchanged engine, for the part the first four pillars
implied but never voiced: *why the learner returns tomorrow*, and *how a wise tutor
carries them through the part where learning is supposed to hurt*. Every load-bearing
claim was assembled by an adversarial research pass (100+ searches, primary sources
fetched, each number verified by a voter told to refute it) and is cited in the new
theory doc. The design rule throughout: **surface what is already true; invent nothing.**

### Theory
- **`docs/05-affective-layers.md`** — the constitution extension. Two new pillars:
  **P13 Competence salience** (making *real* progress visible is a reward without
  gamification's risks — Harkin 2016 d=0.40; Deci/Koestner/Ryan 1999 competence
  feedback d=+0.33 for adults, but d=−0.78 when *controlling*) and **P14 The mentor
  stance** (struggle-as-encoding, absolve-don't-pity, self-generated relevance,
  return-after-absence amnesty — Silverman & Barasch 2023; D'Mello 2014; Graham 1984).
  Includes the adversarial backbone (why *not* to gamify: Sailer & Homner 2020;
  Hanus & Fox 2015; over-helpful AI harms — Bastani 2025) and the ADHD resolution.

### Engine (additive, default-safe — the FSRS core is untouched)
- **`stats.momentum`** — the deterministic core (never the model — Article 10) now
  computes a weekly competence-growth block from real receipts: reviews cleared,
  **days of durability added** (`stability_gained_7d`), genuine recalls, and the
  most-durable memory now. Purely additive to the `stats` JSON; ignored safely if unused.
- **Two self-healed settings keys:** `settings.momentum` (`on`/`off`) and
  `settings.profile` (`null`/`adhd`). A pre-0.4 model missing them is repaired on load
  (as every settings key already is) — behavior is byte-for-byte v0.3 with momentum off.
- Selftests 63 → **68** (durability arithmetic in isolation, in-window filtering, the
  no-negative-growth rule, the momentum block in `stats`, and the settings self-heal).

### Behavior (skills & dialogue grammar — prose, no new commands)
- **Naming real growth** (`/learn`, `/review`): on a genuine stability gain, one flat
  informational line from the engine's own `s_before → s_after` ("holds ~9 days now,
  up from ~2") — never a score, streak, or should-statement; silent when
  `settings.momentum=off` or the gain isn't real.
- **The mentor register** (dialogue grammar): a bounded stance fired only at specific
  moments (difficulty, lapse, return-after-absence, sagging motivation), silence by
  default. Two new lines in the anti-sycophancy oath: *encouragement is information,
  never pressure*; *after a lapse, absolve — never pity*.
- **Return-after-absence amnesty** (`/review`): a large post-gap queue is met with
  amnesty + load renegotiation and a capped catch-up choice — the highest-evidence
  Layer-2 move — instead of dumping the debt.
- **Momentum in the coach** (`/coach`): the check-in opens by *reporting* real progress
  (the intervention itself — Harkin 2016), honestly saying so when nothing grew.
- **ADHD Focus profile** (`settings.profile=adhd`): turns up dials the skills already
  read (Sprint default, immediate growth surfacing, earlier boredom response, optional
  if-then plan, always-on amnesty). No new pedagogy, no game; a declared need, honored.
- README: v0.4 science paragraph, new pillar #5, docs table entry, version → 0.4.0.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-07-06 · bulletproof-foundation hardening + Codex support

A deep hardening pass before new features: every reported bug fixed, plus a full
adversarial sweep of the boundary where LLM/human text enters the deterministic
core. Two independent security audits, two code reviews, and a QA pass fed this;
every fix is locked by a selftest (33 → **63 checks**) and re-verified live.

### Fixes for the reported issues (#1, #2)
- **FSRS-4.5 difficulty anchor corrected.** `next_difficulty` mean-reverted toward `D0(4)` (the FSRS-5 rule) under an otherwise-4.5 engine, inflating interval growth ~21% and silently undershooting the 90% retention target. Now reverts toward `D0(3)`, per the open-spaced-repetition reference. Pinned by a fixed-point selftest. (#1)
- **Evidence before state.** `apply_item` now appends the receipt *before* saving the graph, so a crash (or a bad-type confidence that made `make_receipt` throw) can only ever cost a harmless re-review — never advance mastery with no receipt. (#1)
- **`refit --force` on empty data** no longer divides by zero. (#1)
- **Corrupt state is quarantined, not discarded.** A malformed JSON file is renamed to `<file>.corrupt.<date>` and surfaced by `doctor`, instead of being silently overwritten with defaults. (#1)
- **Calibration scores partial credit correctly.** It now reads the assessor `grade` (recalled=1.0 / partial=0.5 / lapsed=0.0), not the scheduler `rating` — a `hard`/`partial` answer was being scored as a total miss, flipping the verdict to "maximally overconfident". Confidence is clamped to 0–100; a min-n floor (10) replaces definitive verdicts on thin data with `insufficient-data`; encode-time confidences are split into their own pool instead of polluting review calibration. (#2)
- **`next` is stash-aware.** It skips a node whose production is already stashed, and treats a stashed-but-ungraded prerequisite as provisionally met — so the batch-graded `/learn` flow keeps advancing instead of re-serving one node or dead-ending on a chain. Payload now carries `pending_verify` and `provisional_requires`. (#2)
- **`--add-goal`** writes the previously orphan `goals` field; long productions carry a `production_truncated` marker instead of clipping silently. (#2)

### Hardening (found in the sweep)
- **Path-traversal / arbitrary-write closed.** Topic slugs and node ids are validated at every ingress (`add-topic`, `receipt`, `--topic`), and all state writes are confined to the state dir (`report --out` too, unless `--allow-outside`); appends refuse to follow symlinks. An absolute/`..` topic could previously write attacker-controlled JSON anywhere — including a malicious `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- **Shell-injection channel removed.** The skills now pass learner text through a file or stdin (`stash add --file`, `rate --production-file`, `--json -`) and never inline it into a command; a hard rule was added to the dialogue grammar. A production (or a document being taught) containing `'` or `$(…)` can no longer execute.
- **`add-topic` no longer trusts LLM-supplied mastery.** Payload `state`/`fsrs` are ignored (the engine owns scheduling — no mastery without receipts); `--replace` now *preserves* surviving nodes' schedule and writes a `.bak` instead of wiping it; `order` is deduped and requires-cycles are flagged.
- **`model --set` can't brick the install** — it refuses to overwrite an object with a scalar and clamps known numerics (a bad `desired_retention` no longer crashes every `rate`); the learner model self-heals a deleted/mistyped subtree on load.
- **Batch receipts are atomic** — every item is validated (and every node confirmed to exist) before any is applied; the stash self-drains as receipts land.
- **Crash-proofing:** malformed dates, unknown node states, ghost `order` ids, and one corrupt graph no longer brick `topics`/`stats`/`report`/`due`/`session-start`; the session hook only ever echoes validated slugs (closing an indirect prompt-injection vector) and degrades to silence on any failure.
- **Report XSS closed** — every interpolated field (incl. `due`/`lapses`) is escaped.
- **Portability:** dropped the hardcoded personal fallback path; cross-platform dashboard open (`open`/`xdg-open`/`explorer.exe`); scoped the "nothing leaves your machine" claim (the engine never egresses; the curriculum architect uses web search on the topic/goal). `doctor` gained checks for bad states, unparseable dates, and quarantined files.

### Codex support (omni-repo)
- Engram now runs on **OpenAI Codex** from the same repo — `skills/` and `scripts/engram.py` are shared verbatim. Added `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, TOML ports of the three subagents (`codex/agents/*.toml`), a self-resolving SessionStart hook, `scripts/install-codex.sh`, and `INSTALL-CODEX.md`. The Claude Code path is unchanged.

### Known limitation
- Re-running the exact same `receipt --file` twice still double-applies (the settle flow clears the stash after, so the documented path is safe; batch *atomicity* is fixed). Full cross-invocation idempotence is deferred — it needs a stash-id threaded through the assessor contract.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-07-05 · release-hardening after first live dogfood

Every change below traces to something observed in a real `/learn` session.

### Integrity
- **Confidence is never invented.** The dialogue grammar and assessor now hard-require: ask in the same breath as the probe, one casual retry, then record `null`. Calibration counts only numbers the learner actually said. (Found: the tutor had estimated confidences during the first session, silently poisoning calibration.)
- **Pending-verification stash** (`engram.py stash add|list|count|clear`): learner productions are persisted to disk the moment they exist. A crashed or compacted session can no longer lose ungraded work; the session-start hook surfaces leftover items. (Found: the tutor was hand-maintaining scratch files.)

### New capabilities
- **`engram.py report`** — deterministic, self-contained HTML dashboard (per-topic mastery maps with progress bars, retention-by-strength vs. the 85% band, honest calibration, open misconceptions, next-7-days forecast; light+dark, no network, no JS). `/coach dashboard` now uses it.
- **`engram.py refit`** — coarse per-user schedule fit (v1): compares predicted vs. observed recall over ≥50 review receipts and rescales intervals via a clamped multiplier along the FSRS forgetting curve. Guarded and honest about thin data; full FSRS parameter optimization remains future work.
- **`engram.py doctor`** — state/environment diagnostics for troubleshooting installs.

### Bug fixes
- `model --add-interest` dropped all but the last value when passed multiple times in one call (argparse `append` missing). Now keeps every value.
- Streak computation returned 0 when yesterday had activity but today didn't (broken grace-day loop). Rewritten and tested.
- Receipt ids could collide within a fast batch (millisecond timestamps). Now suffixed with a monotonic sequence.

### UX
- `topic-status` renders a progress bar and plain-language legend ("retained / learning / untouched").
- Session ticket and receipt-strip display formats standardized in the dialogue grammar; per-item progress markers in `/review` (`[3/6]`).
- Park-and-resume protocol: mid-session subject changes are parked cleanly; re-anchoring is always from disk.
- Pretest capped at 3 probes (a diagnostic, not an exam); unanswered probes stay untouched without nagging.
- Session-start nudge now also surfaces ungraded pending work.

### Packaging
- MIT LICENSE (swap if you prefer another).
- `ENGRAM_ROOT` env var respected as a dev-clone fallback path in all skills.
- Selftest grown from 18 → 33 checks (stash, refit direction+guard+persistence, report self-containment, doctor, streak cases, id uniqueness, interest append, interval multiplier).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-05

Initial build: FSRS-4.5 deterministic core (`engram.py`, 18-check selftest), three skills (/learn, /review, /coach), three agents (curriculum-architect, assessor, artifact-smith), SessionStart hook, theory docs (foundations, prior art, architecture, roadmap), Explorable Contract.
